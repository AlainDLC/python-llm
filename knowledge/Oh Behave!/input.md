[This book began as an intersection of the two great loves of my life:
dogs and evolution. For years I rolled around in my head how to convey
how exciting and omni-relevant I find evolution to people who are, like
me, avid students of dogs and behavior. In a small way, this is the
result of that effort.]{.calibre7}

[The other piece of the book is my attempt, where I am able, to dig up
answers to questions I hear or am sent about dog training and behavior.
Identifying features of such cases have been altered to protect
anonymity while I tried to preserve the essence of the question, what
that person was really wanting to know. There is also a bit of
editorializing, which, although potentially irksome to readers who do
not share my biases, I hope are thoughtful stabs at some of the issues
in the dog training field. I in no way am under the illusion that I have
any monopoly on truth.]{.calibre7}

shoot a documentary on Pit Bulls. She interviewed a staff member,
Christine, who had a six-year old Pit named Bug. The film-maker asked
her how she came to choose Bug. Christine replied, "Oh, I grew up with
Pit Bulls." All of us looking on nodded sagely, as though that was a

from fruit flies to mice to quail to humans, however I'm not sure we can
glean much about dog selection from this. So, using a wholly unrigorous
approach---mulling it over in the shower and chatting with some dog
friends---I have generated the following list of dog choice
factors.]{.calibre7}

[Ah, Chemistry. I have vivid memories of pressing my face to a pet store
window as a child, longing for the miniature longhaired Dachshund puppy
behind the glass. As an adult I would never patronize a pet store that
sells dogs, however mini longhaired Dachsies still make me weak in the
knees. I've also been known to scream when a really nice Peke enters the
conformation ring. The ideal specimen for me has the appearance of being
from another planet. "Eeeeeeee!!!! I must have one! I must have one!" I
can also get all soft-focus for a well-groomed Maltese or a Toy Poodle
that in any way resembles a lamb.]{.calibre7}

[A friend of mine loves all things Rottie. Even individuals that wildly
diverge from the breed standard, not to mention from what most people
would think of as a handsome dog, make her giddy. Undershot, crazy
leggy, it doesn't matter. Not surprisingly, she has rescued a couple of
hard-luck Rotties and Rottie-like dogs in the time I've known her.
Another friend of mine digs Boston Terriers and French Bulldogs. The key
criterion in her case seems to be the neotenous (squishy puppy-like)
facial features. For this very reason she has squealed next to me while
at ringside during Pekes.]{.calibre7}

narrative of logical-sounding rationalizations, preserving the illusion

that is completely inappropriate for their life situation.]{.calibre7}

[As a child I begged, lobbied, and extorted in my attempts to secure a
dog, preferably a Papillon, mini Dachsie, or variation on the lamb
theme, but was disallowed by my parents. Then my father visited a
relative in Calgary who happened to be into Dobies. Clearly the dogs in
the house won him over because he returned home to declare that I could
have a Doberman. Okay, so it was not a miniature Dachshund. But it had a
leg on each corner, a tail (sort of) and I could actually have one.

[What Sydney is doing---"jumping on the bed when people are in it and
walking on the people"---is an observation. We can all witness it,
quantify it (how many steps, for how long, at what time of day, etc.);
and agree that that is what he is doing. In contrast to observations are
interpretations, which are attempted explanations about why he is doing
what he is doing. Interpretations are stabs at the dog's internal
events---emotions and thoughts that mediate behavior. These internal
events cannot be observed, even with access to brain scanning
technology, which can only record correlates (like blood flow in
specific regions) to other observable events (like behavior or a
person's stated thoughts). In the domestic dog behavior community, there
is a veritable cottage industry in interpreting what dogs do. The part
that concerns me is the way many of these guesses are passed off as fact
or strongly supported theory.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[No one can "observe" that a dog is establishing dominance or pretending
to hunt for birds, thinking a particular thought, or even that the dog
is thinking at all (including in pictures). These are all
interpretations. One can observe that a dog is jumping on a bed and
walking around under certain circumstances. One can observe facial
expressions, vocalizations, and differences in the environment that make
him more or less likely to do it or stop doing it. One can then generate
hypotheses about why he does it. Interpretations are kind of like
hypotheses that never undergo testing the way formal hypotheses
do.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Interpretations are useful insofar as they help us "chunk" observations
into useful constructs---rather than saying "the dog put his front legs
parallel to the ground, opened his mouth on the horizontal axis by two
and one half inches past baseline, held his tail at ten degrees past
vertical and moved it at a frequency of six cycles per second and an
amplitude of\..." we say "the dog is soliciting play." This is an
interpretation, in this case one that is well supported by replicable
observation of what happens next when virtually all dogs do this
behavior.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[This chunking in turn helps us to understand behavior in a deeper, more
meaningful way. The danger with interpretations of hidden
events---especially of the "one dog did this once" variety---is that
they are notoriously difficult to falsify. No one can prove you wrong.
The philosopher Bertrand Russell once mused that there was a small china
teapot in perfect elliptical orbit around the sun. No one can prove him
wrong so it might very well be there. The question then becomes, "is it
likely?" The maxim in science is "big claims need big
evidence."]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[There is some merit to sticking to observations as much as possible and
avoiding the temptation to invent interpretations, however intuitive
they might feel. This tendency to stick to observations for pragmatic
purposes is known as behaviorism. Behaviorism put forward the idea of a
black box---the animal's internal machinations---and that understanding
of these inner workings were not necessary in order to conceptualize
and, ultimately, control behavior. It's not true that behaviorists deny
there is anything going on in the black box of the animal's brain. It's
that they don't think it's necessary or particularly relevant when it
comes to modifying behavior. Behaviorism has fallen wildly out of favor
in psychology, but is extremely useful in one particular domain of
relevance to us doggie people: animal training.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Opinions, not surprisingly, differ when it comes to interpreting dog
behavior. One fantastic example is dogs that growl, snarl, or snap when
approached while eating or chewing a bone. An interpreter from the
behaviorism school would say "the dog growled when the approacher came
within five feet and from the dog's right." Another interpreter would
say "the dog is displaying his dominance." The latter would likely lay
out a plan to lower the dog's presumed status in the family hierarchy,
whereas the behaviorist would lay out a modification strategy to stop
the dog growling when he's approached with a bone.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Another example comes from the animal sheltering world. The prevailing
culture is one of ascribing character traits rather than describing what
dogs do while in the shelter or during an intake test. The very terms
used to describe tests that shelters use belie their bias for or against
behaviorism. For instance, being of the behaviorist ilk, at the San
Francisco SPCA we conduct "Behavior Evaluations," which are quantified
tests of what dogs do when, for example, approached while eating,
handled on various parts of their body, or when meeting another dog.
Many other shelters conduct "Temperament Tests," which may use similar
scenarios, but frame testee responses more in terms of set, unyielding
traits the dog has rather than something the dog did. Dogs are
"dominant," "submissive," "pushy," etc. rather than doing X, Y, or
Z.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Supporters of the fixed temperament construct feel they have uncovered
a dog's immutable essence with the right test, whereas behaviorists are
more inclined to think that "this is what the dog did in this
circumstance on this day." They will then measure whether this is
predictive of behavior in the adopter's home. Behaviorists are also more
likely to then ask, "do you want more or less of this behavior" and
proceed to change it. Fixed temperament aficionados might feel that a
dog who performs well on a temperament test after training or behavior
modification has (presumably dangerously) had his true nature masked
whereas a behaviorist would, on the same basis, question the value of
the "temperament" construct in this context.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Regardless of who is right, there is no denying that humans are drawn
to the idea of "temperament." Humans got in line twice for doses of what
psychologists call "theory of mind"---the ability to imagine the
internal events of someone else, and we seem to project madly and
gleefully across species lines. Discussions about temperament, for
instance, are far from unique to dogs. Hamster people don't just
describe what hamsters do, they refer to different hamster temperaments,
as do hobbyists who are into gerbils, hedgehogs, snakes, salamanders,
box turtles, guppies, goldfish, and iguanas ("iguanas that are switched
from small cages to free-roaming demonstrate an improvement in
temperament"). Even tarantula owners describe their charges as
"secretive," "cautious," "methodical," "peaceful," and "spunky" rather
than observing and quantifying tarantula behavior. Box turtles are
described as "full of personality." Goldfish, too, have "loads of
personality" and one even, according to the owner "discovered that
bubbles are fun."]{.calibre7}

[Interpreting behavior, quite aside from its usefulness, is so
reinforcing to people it is unlikely to diminish any time soon. There
are, however, small signs of increasing circumspection about the guesses
dog people make about dog behavior, which is no doubt very reinforcing
to behaviorists. The bottom line is for all of us to know the difference
between observations and interpretations and to be up front about
labeling interpretations as such when we make them.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[The reason is domestication. Whereas humans have exerted formidable
selection pressure on dogs vis-a-vis their body shapes, sizes, coat
features, and certain precisely defined utilitarian behaviors, other
pressures, such as for traits that would help a dog make a living in a
wild environment, have been relaxed. Put it this way: virtually 100% of
red foxes have a nice, strong, highly stereotyped food-caching behavior.
They will bury unused food portions using a standardized set of actions
and then return to them later. This standardized set of actions common
to all members of a species is called a fixed action pattern (FAP).
Fixed action patterns require no learning though sometimes will become
refined with practice. Eminently useful, like bundled software. Foxes
born with mutations that weaken or edit out FAPs, like food-caching, are
at a sufficient disadvantage in that they tend to not live long enough
to pass on this variation to their offspring. So the gene(s) for the
trait fixes at 100% frequency in the population. In dogs, by contrast,
any such mutation would be invisible to evolution, i.e., neutral: dogs
like Jordan, who retain the trait from food-caching wolf ancestors,
provided they passed muster with regards to designated breeding
criteria, would pass it on, and---this is Important---so would dogs
without the burying tendency. Think of it as a social safety net for
non-food-caching dogs.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[This same effect can result in a partially retained or inexpertly
targeted fixed action pattern, such as Jordan's rather feckless choice
of sofa and air as media, and his immediate consumption (never mind that
many dogs do it, as Jordon does, with non-food items, inefficient at
best in cost-benefit terms). Dogs are treasure troves of behaviors that
have drifted all over the map in the absence of certain key selection
pressures. The predatory behavior department also abounds with great
examples. While selection pressure has been exerted in certain breeds to
magnify pieces of the wolf predation sequence---think herding, pointing,
retrieving, and terriers grimly hanging on---others have been left to
drift. Most dogs no longer hunt for a living. And so some dogs, like
Border Collies, are turned on by any moving object, some by moving
critters only, and some by nothing. Many dogs will perform a
grab-and-shake on a toy, a nifty neck-breaking behavior for small prey
items, but not all dogs do. It's a safe bet that 100% of wolves have
more than a passing interest in critters, and can dispatch small
prey.]{.calibre7}

of evisceration of stuffed animals. Many of us have had dogs that, once

minutes. And many of us have also had dogs that, ten years later, still

[Reproductive behavior is another realm of some interesting diversity in
dogs. Not all dogs can successfully reproduce unassisted. While in many
such cases this is a collateral effect of unhelpful conformation, in
others the barrier is behavioral rather than anatomical. One interesting
example is a range of perseverance in males. Due to the nature of the
estrous cycle in dogs, bitches are highly attractive before they are
receptive. Ian Dunbar has proposed that this early-in-cycle onset of
attractiveness is an adaptation in free-ranging dogs to accumulate
suitors and then vet them for fitness. It's in her genetic interest to
have some significant choice of fathers when she's finally receptive,
and as free-ranging dogs appear to be fairly nomadic, this may take some
time. A possible result of this is the evolution in such populations of
a stronger than average if-at-first-you-don' t-succeed-try-again trait
in males: if they're snarked (trainer-speak for a snarl-bark hybrid) off
once, do they take their marbles and go home or do they bounce back and
persevere ("How about now??). Those in the latter group will still be
present when she finally becomes receptive. Enter selective breeding. If
he's handsome and clever to humans, it matters not that he is a total

likely two-fold: lowering of disease risk through better hygiene and
better predator avoidance due to the waste-free nest's lower olfactory

[In contrast to widely retained maternal coprophagia is regurgitation.
100% of adult wolves in a pack, including aunts and uncles, will
regurgitate food if puppies paw and lick at their mouths when they
return from hunting. This behavior is only occasionally seen in nursing
bitches and, even more rarely, in other adult dogs. It's possible that
this trait drifted more than maternal coprophagia because of greater
across-the-board sustenance support in early human-reared dog
populations, i.e., the safety net of food was more steadily supplied
than house-cleaning services. The pressure remained on the latter trait
and forced its retention.]{.calibre7}

[And, speaking of starvation, the tendency to gorge, i.e., eat waaaaay
more than required for immediate energy needs, has clearly been retained
in dogs judging by the epidemic of obesity in our pets. Wolves are
subject to a feast-famine lifestyle where it is highly adaptive to tank
up when food is available, but remove the famine part, as with pet dogs,
and the pounds pile on. Our human fondness for foods high in fat and
sugar is similarly a retained and now maladaptive trait that, for the
most part, fails to cull us before reproductive age and so is invisible
to natural selection. Bet you wish that one had drifted in you,

[I recently read a dog training article in which the author asserts that
dogs care about the order of exit through doorways. The indisputably
popular notion that the dog charges through the doorway ahead of the
owner to establish dominance is implausible to me. If it were true,
though, this notion is certainly symptomatic of an undesirable state of
affairs (dog thinks he can dominate owner). Yet people choose to believe
it. It seems that the more unbearable thought to some people is that
they might be completely irrelevant, i.e., the dog is not considering
the owner at all in the presence of an open door to the outdoors. To
dominance fans, in other words, even when things are not as they should
be (dog is dominating owner), the dog's behavior is at least in relation
to them.]{.calibre7}

[In her outstanding paper "A Struggle for Dominance---Fact or Fiction,"
Susan Friedman, professor of applied behavior analysis and parrot
aficionado, addresses the use of dominance as explanation for (from our
perspective) misbehavior of parrots. For example, are parrots that don't
step up to be returned to their cages exerting dominance over their
owners or do they just prefer to not go back into their cages and so
engage in behaviors---notably aggression---that work to that end? Sound
familiar, dog people?]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Friedman points out that dominance is a construct, an inference about
how or why an animal behaves as it does. And while constructs can be
efficient chunking devices for constellations of behavior, they can also
retard true understanding. They are "tightly bound by our own genetic,
cultural and personal perspective. For most of us, thinking outside the
proverbial 'box' to truly understand a child, spouse or friend is tough
enough. Thinking outside one's own taxonomic \[order\] is an
extraordinary challenge." Constructed explanations are also not
falsifiable. This is especially true of dominance where any observation
that contradicts a particular model can be explained away with a new,
just-so addendum. For example, if in a supposed linear hierarchy a lower
ranked dog is observed to get priority access to an important resource,
dominance proponents will invoke a "temporary rank reversal," "order is
in flux lately," or even "well, he's not feeling well today" clause to
protect the system. And this pre-supposes that all observations that
contradict the system are not filtered out in the first
place!]{.calibre7}

lazily-executed, informal search on Google will yield scores of research
papers on cheetah reproductive physiology, hundreds on woodpecker
foraging strategies, and thousands on ant social behavior, so you'd
think there'd be roomfuls on dog hierarchies given the abandon with
which we employ dominance to explain behavior and develop modification
strategies. But I suspect the ground for Build Your Own Catchy Social

[Ah, but what about wolves?! Everybody knows that wolves form linear
hierarchies (except when they don't!). In wolves, as in any
non-domesticated species, social dominance is useless unless it confers
reproductive advantage. A spectacular example with actual support is
elephant seals, wherein male size results in victory over other males,
which in turn pays off with near monopoly of a harem of females in a
given season. The size of male elephant seals has been ratcheted up by
this high stakes arms race. Among dog people then, not surprisingly, it
is a well-worn dictum that the alpha pair are the exclusive breeders in
a wolf pack (except when they're not), get first crack at carcasses
(except when they don't), and lead the pack in its various
activities.]{.calibre7}

[Here's the rub. In a wild wolf pack, the "alpha" pair are parents in a
nuclear family. They breed because they are socially mature adults. They
are dominant over their offspring because parents can be said to be
"dominant" over their children. Professor L. David Mech has researched
wild wolves across the globe for nearly forty years and I had the
pleasure of chatting with him in Minnesota last year. He is perplexed by
the love affair with dominance among wolf people given that offspring in
a wolf pack, if they live, inevitably reach reproductive age, disperse
in order to find mates, reproduce and start their own packs. In all his
years of research, he never saw an animal fail to reproduce if it lived
long enough, making all wolves "alphas" once they mate.]{.calibre7}

[Mech fears that some of his own early writings on wolves have fanned
the dominance flames and many of these writings are no longer under his

papers debunking dominance-as-trait, but this has yet to slow down dog
people.]{.calibre7}

[So why is dominance so hot? The answer might lie in human brains. In a
2002 paper published in [Nature Neuroscience,]{.italic} Duke University
researchers Scott Huettel, Beau Mack, and Gregory McCarthy found
evidence of a brain module that compulsively seeks patterns whether
there are actually any or not, and even when we have been made
consciously aware that there are no patterns. In one experiment,
subjects knew they were seeing random sequences of shapes, but their
brains couldn't help but find "patterns." It could be that any perceived
asymmetry in our dogs' win-loss records or dealings with other dogs will
cause us to see a pattern such as, say, a hierarchy. And, any pattern
that is (or is not) there usually prompts the search for explanations.

[Early dog development has been divided into various periods. These
discrete envelopes were proposed for our convenient identification and
classification; the actual developmental process is, of course,
continuous. The periods are: neonatal, transitional, and
socialization.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The neonatal period begins at birth and extends until approximately
fourteen days. The abilities and deficits of neonate puppies are well
researched. Neonates, aside from having a well-developed sucking reflex,
can do the following things on their own: crawl (not walk), distress
vocalize, respond to tactile stimuli, and right themselves if they
tumble onto their backs (my colleague Janis Bradley affectionately
refers to them as being more like cockroaches than turtles in this
regard). Conspicuously absent are the abilities to maintain a steady
body temperature and to eliminate solo. Although destined to be
thermoregulatory pros once adult, as are all mammals and birds, young
puppies require careful attention to the temperature around them. They
can do a little for themselves by spreading out when too warm and
heaping together when cold, but that's it. And so exposure is too common
a cause of neonate mortality.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Most neonates will urinate and defecate only in response to tactile
stimulation. This is part of a system they co-evolved with their
mothers. When the dam licks the puppies, they eliminate and the dam then
eats the products. The result is the maintenance of a nest that is more
hygienic and less conspicuous to predators. Interestingly, in spite of
the relaxation of selection pressure for this system by domestication
(i.e., most dogs without the trait still get hygiene support from human
care-takers), it persists in most dogs. Compared to other
can't-do-without-in-a-wild-context traits such as carcass dissection or
food guarding, both of which have drifted significantly in domestic dogs
and so are present in some individuals but not all, the nest-maintenance
system is a curious hanger-on. It could be that litters are on their own
enough of the time to render the system still valuable.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Following the neonatal period is the transitional period, which lasts
until both the eyes and ears are open, usually by around age three
weeks. Puppies in this fourteen to twenty-one day age range still have a
relatively mask-like expression. They can stand and sometimes take a few
faltering steps. Fascinatingly, it has been demonstrated that they can
learn through reinforcement at this age. The mind runs amok with visions
of itsy bitsy sits and downs in exchange for access to mom or a lap of
liver infused milk. It could be, by the way, that neonates can also
learn through reinforcement, however it has not yet been authoritatively
proven.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The transitional period transitions to the much-talked-about
socialization period. This is considered to be a sensitive period where
experiences can have profound and lifetime effects on the puppy.
Specifically, the puppy is forming a catalog of targets for social
bonding. There is a convincing body of research that demonstrates that
puppies that are not exposed to people during this period end up with
severe and possibly refractory fearfulness of humans. It is therefore
vital that puppies are socialized. There is not perfect agreement about
what the cut-off age to achieve this is. Proposed ends to the
socialization period range from eleven weeks to eighteen weeks. Some
experts have suggested that there may be different envelopes for
different breeds. However, as you point out, there is very good
consensus that one gets better bang for their buck socialization-wise,
the earlier one starts, regardless of the official end of the
socialization period.]{.calibre7}

[Most puppies are not in the hands of owners until age seven weeks or
more. Breeders, therefore, play an incredibly important role. Ian Dunbar
has suggested that a primary criterion for breeder selection be the
location where the litter is whelped. He would like to see all litters
reared in a relatively high traffic area of the home, such as the
kitchen or family room. No kennels, no garages, no back rooms. The
reason for this is the benefit of constant passive exposure to household
sights and sounds: kitchen appliance noises, conversation, TV, people
walking around, vacuum cleaner, etc. from day one. Dunbar has also urged
puppy buyers to be smart shoppers and request quantification of
socialization efforts from breeders, i.e., how many new people per day
the puppies have met and in what demographic categories. If the number
is low (e.g. the family members and a few friends or neighbors), move
on.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Another intriguing snippet of research that points to ultra-early
intervention is the work of Carmen Battaglia on early puppy stimulation.
He found that neonates that received mild, specific tactile stimuli on a
daily basis grew up to be more stress resilient as adults. This finding
begs for replication and an expanded research effort to determine
exactly what breeders could be doing to further optimize early
environment for the puppies they produce.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[As far as training, there is a lack of research regarding optimal ages
to start---or cut-off ages to complete---various tasks. In spite of this
there is still a strong and fairly widely held feeling that earlier is
better. It's been demonstrated that puppies aged two to three weeks can
learn so the ideal starting age may creep downwards even more from the
current "begin the day you bring your puppy home." Once again, this
points to the vital role of breeders in the education of
puppies.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[Puppy classes for puppies aged seven to eleven weeks are gaining
momentum. I think two factors are driving this. One is the increasing
sense of urgency to exploit the earlier-is-better dictum. And, if those
authorities that postulate an end to the socialization period at twelve
or fourteen weeks are correct, the urgency is even greater. The other
factor is the increasing evidence that the disease risk to puppies
attending classes is not as great as once feared. Epidemiologist and
veterinary behaviorist R.K. Anderson and veterinarians at Purdue
University, among others, have gone on record that not only do the
behavioral benefits outweigh the risk of exposure to pathogens in a
puppy class, but that the disease risk of a properly run puppy class has
been overblown. A properly run class means:]{.calibre7}

variable is enormous." What he meant was that of all the factors that
make up a dog's behavior---his genetics, puppy-hood, training, nutrition
and health, and environment---the dog's daily interactions with the
owner are extremely influential. I'd go one step further to include in
the owner variable the owner's decisions about training, nutrition and
health, and the dog's living situation. It's as though the owner puts a
signature on the dog, and this is what I suspect you notice as that
common denominator in the dogs you've owned.]{.calibre7}

runs around shaking his head. Person two might punish the dog and person
three ignore him. Aside from any future likelihood of sock-directed
behavior, there is also likely some mild effect on "picking things up"
period or even "trying out a new behavior." There is no right or wrong
answer here, just different ripples from different responses. Along with
laughing or cheering, we smile at, attend to our dogs, and commence
activities they like in a non-random way. Sometimes their behavior
influences the timing of these events. When it does, expect there to be
some gradual conditioning of behavior over time. You have apparently

(and whether we make it fun for them as you have clearly done), walk our
dogs, take them places that are fun for dogs, and take them to places
that are usually less fun such as to veterinarians. This is partly
dictated by necessity but also partly a function of someone's built-in
tendency. For instance, compare any two dog owners and they will have
different symptom thresholds that prompt them to bring their dog to the
veterinarian. If a certain dog finds this a very stressful event and
happens to belong to an owner who makes frequent trips, there will be an
impact. Once again, this is not a value judgment---clearly people's
decisions regarding veterinary care must be respected and clearly there
are huge advantages to the better-safe-than-sorry philosophy. The point
is that every single choice we make has ripples. All the ripples
together are the owner signature. The fact that all your dogs were

these regimes will impact the dog's style of walking on leash. Some
owners talk to their dogs a lot, some very little. Dogs whose owners
talk to them all the time will have habituated much more to the sound of
their owner's voice. They may also have doped out the nuances of certain

a roomful of dog people and ask who has the cutest dog, most people will
put up their hands. This is partly due to the fact that most people
chose their dog and this choice is usually at least partly based on
"chemistry," the technical term for "s/he's cute" or "this breed is

[When dogs play, they borrow behaviors from other more goal-oriented
activities---fighting, fleeing, hunting, and courtship---and jumble them
all together, sometimes with key modifications. What's even more
fascinating than the question of how you or I can tell it's play, is how
the dogs can tell it's play, given that play consists of things like
biting, body-slamming, jaw-wrestling with flashing toothy displays,
chasing, pinning, and mounting! The answer lies in those key
modifications and in what's called meta-communication. The two critical
modifications to the "four F's" (fighting, fleeing, feeding and
courtship) are:]{.calibre7}

[The result of this self-handicapping is that during play you will
regularly see a larger, stronger dog spending time "pinned" on the
bottom, allowing himself to be bitten, and fighting and biting back with
reduced intensity.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Meta-communication, or meta-signaling, is the other feature of play
that distinguishes it from its goal-directed counterparts. A
meta-communication is a message that qualifies other behaviors that come
before and after it. It's the dog's way of saying "I'm about to bite,
chase, snarl, and body-slam you, but it's just play." Ian Dunbar calls
them "atmosphere cues" because of the tone, or atmosphere, that they
set. Meta-signals are necessary because of the ambiguity of play
behaviors. The meta-signals dogs use include play-bows---front quarters
down, rear up, play face---an unmistakable open, wild-eyed, grinning
expression; and exaggerated movements like inefficient, bouncy, rocking
horse gaits, and unnecessary dekes to the side. Contrast this with a dog
chasing a squirrel---efficient, flat-out running, not
gamboling.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[When meta-signaling, self-handicapping, and role-reversals slip too low
or are not present at all, play doesn't look right, seeming to heat up
and becomes overly intense. The dog whose play lacks these features may
look like a broken record, repeating the same thing over and over,
seemingly oblivious to the unwelcome effect it's having. The dog on the
receiving end might at first continue to try to play normally but soon
becomes distressed and signals "please stop" or "back off." If the dog
with the play skill deficit does not read or respect this signal,
fisticuffs may ensue, or bullying if the receiver opts not to defend.
Such dogs may have adequate play histories, so it seems to not be an
experiential deficit. Pit Bulls are over-represented among dogs with
this play style, so I surmise a genetic component. These players can be
reformed by teaching them to break off before they heat up and, once
they are able to do so, abruptly terminating their opportunity to play
when they fail to heed warnings to break off.]{.calibre7}

you're unsure, is the one your puppy class instructor did: restrain the
presumed bully and see what the presumed victim does once free to
escape. I would also suggest that while you're watching Danny play,
count the number of times you observe full or partial play-bows, play
face, and bouncy movements. It's clear from the history that he is doing
an exemplary job inhibiting the force of his bites.]{.calibre7}

[This pulling of punches is one of the conundrums of understanding the
function of play. Why do animals play? Most mammals and many birds are
believed to play and the behavior is not cheap---It takes time and
energy, risks injury and, in the case of prey species, reduces vigilance
as well as making them more conspicuous to predators. Considering these
costs, there must be off-setting benefits. The leading contender among
theories of the function of play is that it is some sort of rehearsal of
the behaviors it borrows from.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Animals play most as juveniles and the type of play uncannily resembles
key adult behaviors. For instance, predatory species like dogs, bite and
chase a lot during play, and prey species like deer play escaping games.
Male deer also play head-butting. Male sea lion pups bite five times
more often than females. All this points to the rehearsal theory, but
there are a couple of snags. One is that the pulling of punches,
role-reversal, and inefficiency that make play play, also make it a poor
means of combat rehearsal or prey killing. And, according to research to
date, depriving juvenile animals of play does not seem to compromise
their ability to function as adults, notably to perform the behaviors
play is alleged to be rehearsing. We are talking about a paltry amount
of research, however, and it is possible that tiny amounts of play are
enough to confer benefit. But then, if tiny amounts are enough, why do
so many species pay the higher cost of heftier amounts of play? The
mystery of the function of play is yet to be unraveled but, in the
meantime, we can enjoy watching dogs who are so masterful at
it!]{.calibre7}

astounding accuracy. Not only do they know what time dinners and walkies
are, they know whether it's Agility class night or not. Dogs are also
masterful at noticing small cues in their environments to tip them off
about what's going on. Ever noticed that your dog has learned that you
turning the TV off at night means the next thing is bed time, and so
trundles off unbidden? Whereas TV turn-off on Saturday afternoon is more
ambiguous. Could be walkies. Could be car-rides. Could be nothing. Has
your dog doped out that keys plus briefcase equal the abyss of solitude
for a few hours whereas the same keys plus a "Chuckit™" mean nirvana at
the dog park? Does your dog know the road's turn-off to the dog park?

teach a dog a category like "shoe," given that shoes might be leather,
fabric, rubber, have laces or not, be light, strappy and open, or weigh
several pounds. Humans are very good at this kind of classification by
function or other high concept. Dogs are less about headings and more
about specific case. It's a no-brainer for a dog to learn that this shoe
here is his to dissect at will, but those leather goods on the racks in
the closet and the ones on the entryway mat? Strictly verboten. I know

readily than both chimpanzees and wolves. Even kennel-reared dogs
outperformed hand-reared wolves, suggesting that the capacity is not a
product of lots of experience around people. Part of dogs'
specialization is clearly making the most of their human-rich
environment. It's also been suggested by a study that dogs gauge their
play solicitations to other dogs based on whether the potential playmate
is attending or not. Dog behavior researcher Marc Bekoff points out that
dogs are clearly by no means "dumbed down wolves."]{.calibre7}

[There's no way to---pardon the pun---intelligently discuss cognition
without drawing the distinction between what has been scientifically
proven and what most people believe based on interpretations of their

cold, as though science rains on some sort of confabulation parade. But
the (very interesting) fact of the matter is, there is enormous
discrepancy in key areas between what people think dogs are good at and
what dogs are actually good at as soon as other explanations are ruled
out. It's why we love science so. Let me give you an
example.]{.calibre7}
:::

[I doubt there's a day that goes by wherein a dog trainer somewhere is
not regaled by an owner about how his dog imitates. This dog imitates
that dog. The puppy imitated the resident adult. The dog imitated the
owner, the cat, or the budgie. Poll dog owners, even dog fanciers, and
they will tell you, yes, dogs can imitate. One dog peed. Then the other
one did. See? Or the more sophisticated version: one dog opened the
latch, broke into the yard, and terrorized the ducks. Then the other dog
did it. First time ever. See?]{.calibre7}

[The sticky thing is that many processes can account for an animal
seeming to do something after witnessing a model, not just imitation.
And, as soon as conditions are controlled so that those other means are
not available, dogs suddenly can't "imitate." Imitation is defined as an
animal replicating the behavior of another animal after one viewing. The
behavior can't be a fixed action pattern such as barking, urinating,
chasing something, etc. Many such behaviors are readily socially
facilitated---triggered in a non-imitative way, or ratcheted up in
intensity---in dogs. Right off the bat many imitation anecdotes are out
of the running. There can't be enhancement of a key spot or thing via
intense activity: does witnessing random but intense and apparently
successful activity of a model dog at the latch help as much as
witnessing a skillful latch manipulator dog? If it does, it's not
imitation. Such "two-action tests" are the current gold standard for
inferring imitation and dogs are so far unimpressive at them. The
behavior must be novel to make the criteria for imitation. And learning
processes such as operant conditioning must be ruled out. Bottom line:
in spite of some effort to find evidence of imitation in dogs,
researchers so far have come up empty-handed. So, if dogs can imitate,
there is a global canine conspiracy to keep science in the dark about
it.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Now, that said, there are some intriguing whiffs of proto-imitation in
the dog cognition research. For example, if you put a dog behind a
fence, put a toy on the other side and demonstrate one of two possible
detours around the fence, the dog is more likely than chance to take the
detour you showed him. Which brings us back to domain-specific talents.
This detour copying is imitative, no doubt about it. But it's limited to
this domain: route-taking. Dogs don't have the all-purpose
imitate-anyone-doing-anything module we humans take for granted. To me,
this is the heart of the divide between what science tells us dogs can
(and can't) do and what people continue to insist they can. Imitation
comes so incredibly readily to us that we can't imagine a mind that
can't do it. We especially can't imagine a familiar mind that can't do
it. And, given that humans are capable of ascribing agency to cartoon
sponges, it's not surprising that our theory of mind module runs amok
when it comes to those most splendid of surrogate children, our dogs.
They are very, very like us. They bond readily and strongly. They feel
palpably similar emotions. They are fabulous consequence learners. Their
proto-theory-of-mind module seems able to dope out whether another dog
is attending or not. So when they appear to do something that we would
have done via imitation, we project imitative ability.]{.calibre7}

And you're also right here---it's not boredom.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The leading explanation for Arnold's yawning is that it was a
displacement behavior. This is an action that pops out when an animal is
in conflict about how to respond to something. In this case, he might
have been in conflict about whether to flee, fight the bath, or simply
give up and allow it. The conflict produces low-grade stress and this
can manifest as a behavior with no relevance or relation to the
context.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Have you ever noticed dogs yawning during sit-stays, in vet waiting
rooms, or when they're slightly worried about something? Displacement.
You may also have seen a cat stalking a bird, rush and narrowly miss
catching it, and then suddenly groom himself. This would also likely be
classified as a displacement behavior. The minor stress secondary to the
thwarted hunting attempt fuels displacement grooming. (Many people,
naturally, think the cat is embarrassed and trying to act
"casual.")]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Displacement behaviors are often self-directed: animals might groom or
rub themselves, and humans scratch their heads when confused or solving
a problem. An interesting study on chimpanzees a few years ago
demonstrated that as they were given progressively more difficult
problems to solve, the chimpanzees engaged in more and more
self-directed behaviors. But, if they were given auditory cues to let
them know they were on the right track (conditioned reinforcers, in
effect!), the self-directed behaviors were reduced. This suggests that
positive feedback reduces the stress of solving a problem.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[You asked whether Arnold's yawn might have been a calming signal. If I
understand calming signals correctly, they are communications to other
animals. Like appeasement gestures, they have as their objective to
inhibit aggression in the other animal. A case could possibly be made
that what would normally be classified as a simple displacement behavior
may have signaling value or intention in some instances. But in other
cases, the case is too weak as there is nobody around to signal to. The
behavior quite predictably pops out when the animal is stressed or
worried, period. So, I'd say beware of over-interpretation
here.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[Displacement behavior is not quite the same as redirected behavior.
Redirected behavior is an action that fits the context well but is
performed toward an alternative target. If a dog is highly motivated to
attack another dog, but is prevented by his leash from doing so, he may
bite the leash or even his handler. Two dogs agitating behind a fence at
a passer-by might unload their frustration on each other. Contrast this
with displacement activities, which are performed at the right target
(i.e., grooming oneself) but at the "wrong" time (when in conflict). So,

conflicts experimentally. He divided these into three main
types:]{.calibre7}

[External conflicts are between constraints imposed by the external
environment and the animal's motivation. This is known as thwarting.
Unlike internal conflicts, in thwarting scenarios the animal's
motivational ducks are in a row, but the behavior the animal has
"decided" upon is physically impossible. Imagine, for instance, making
an authoritative decision to flee a predator but having your leg caught
under a rock. Very stressful, but in a different way from having a hard
time making a decision. Barrier frustration is the most common dog
example.]{.calibre7}

:::

::: calibre17
[Konrad Lorenz also had a well known take on displacement activities.
They fit well into his hydraulic model of behavior. He submitted that
"action-specific energy" was a force inside the animal and that it
accumulated over time. Dogs might, for example, build up "play energy,"
"chasing energy," or "barking energy." When enough specific energy had
built up, an animal would feel generally more energized. If it
encountered an environmental trigger that corresponded to a particular
filled-up reservoir, a fixed action pattern would be
released.]{.calibre7}

[If, according to Lorenz, energy had built up in the reservoirs for more
than one action and the animal encountered triggers for two opposing
behaviors, energy would overflow and a displacement behavior could be
released. You can see how this mirrors the approach-avoidance conflict
model. Two "drives" kick in simultaneously. Lorenz also postulated that
"vacuum behaviors"---the appearance of a fixed action pattern without
its characteristic trigger---are the result of overflowing specific
reservoirs.]{.calibre7}

[The "affects or might affect" wording in your question is very
important. It points to the two different bases for fiddling with
nutrition in dogs with a view to improving behavior. One is empirical
research: well-controlled studies on the effects on behavior of
manipulating diet components or supplementation in dogs. When dogs---or
a subgroup of dogs, such as those with a certain behavior
problem---consume X amount of substance Y, Z change in behavior is
measurable. Then, when a reliable, replicable effect is found,
mechanisms will be proposed: how and why does this manipulation exert an
effect? Because there is a lot known about biochemical mechanisms, this
can direct further research efforts to increase and refine knowledge of
empirical effects.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Which brings us to the second source for gleaning insights about
nutrition and behavior: known mechanisms. Because the empirical research
on nutrition and behavior in dogs is so incredibly scarce, we're left
speculating about interventions that might plausibly exert an effect
based on what's known about food, supplements, and the brain. This is
much, much weaker, in my opinion, than a bona fide empirical result, but
at the very least this approach can suggest where research efforts could
be directed. Also, in the absence of empirical knowledge, it could be
argued that it's better than nothing in an individual case to play
around with nutrition and supplements that are in the
can't-hurt-might-help category.]{.calibre7}

:::

::: calibre17
[Let's look at the empirical research first. Two studies, one in 1996
and one in 2000, tentatively concluded that low protein diets can reduce
aggression. Both compared diets in the 17-18% protein range with diets
in the 30-32% protein range. One study also looked at supplementing the
amino acid tryptophan to the two diets and found that for aggression
directed at the family, either the tryptophan addition or reduced
protein, had a favorable impact, while both interventions were necessary
to reduce aggression directed at strangers.]{.calibre7}

[This is far from a slam dunk for the low protein connection. It raised
consternation in the natural/raw food diet crowd, whose dogs routinely
consume relatively high protein diets and who claim favorable effects on
behavior from such a diet. As for empirical research, one study in 2002
found that a diet higher in digestible protein and fat reduced
reactivity in shelter dogs. So much, much more needs to be done to
clarify what's going on vis-a-vis dietary protein and
aggression.]{.calibre7}

dietary components and the brain in a wide variety of species, including
humans, performed in an attempt to increase understanding of human
behavior and mental disorders. Are there grounds for inference from
these studies for those of us in dog behavior? There might be. Dogs have
been relatively popular animal models in human nutrition research over
the years (unfortunately on other topics in nutrition than behavior) and
so much is known about the validity of extrapolating results from dog to
human subjects. It therefore holds water that we might be able to go the
other way---from humans to dogs---in extrapolating results from research
on diet, supplementation and human neurochemistry.]{.calibre7}

[There are three types of neurotransmitters---chemical messengers---in
the brain: large neuropeptides, such as beta-endorphins; and two kinds
of smaller molecules, amino acids, such as GABA, the inhibitor molecule,
and glutamate, the excitatory molecule, and, finally, monoamines. The
monoamines, though small in percentage, are huge in influence. They have
been strongly implicated again and again in affecting everything from
violent behavior and impulsivity to compulsive behavior, anxiety, and
depression. They may even be the master regulators of the amino acid
neurotransmitters.]{.calibre7}

:::

::: calibre17
[Monoamines come in four varieties: the catecholamines (notably dopamine
and norepinephrine), acetylcholine, histamine (which promotes
wakefulness---this is why anti-histamines can make you drowsy), and
serotonin. They are synthesized from precursor molecules and then stored
in vessicles in pre-synaptic neurons, the cells on the sending side of
the gap between brain cells. Once released, they park in receptor sites
on post-synaptic neurons, thus allowing communication between cells.
Monoamines are then inactivated in two ways, either by being captured by
re-uptake transporters to be stored in the pre-synaptic vessicles for
next time, or else degraded into their constituents by monoamine oxidase
enzymes.]{.calibre7}

[A veritable cornucopia of medications has been developed to manipulate
this system (see Understanding Psychotropic Medications in Section 4).
It has also proven responsive to diet. For instance, the essential amino
acid tryptophan is a precursor (building block) of serotonin, the
monoamine most implicated in aggression, anxiety, and low impulse
control. Research has shown that in rats and humans, a tryptophan
deficient diet increases aggressiveness. Evidence like this along with
the tryptophan supplementation and aggression study mentioned earlier
suggests that precursor loading---the provision of extra building blocks
of key neurotransmitters in the diet---could be an avenue worth
exploring more in dogs. Tryptophan rich foods include turkey,
grapefruit, bananas, and milk.]{.calibre7}

[Measurable increases in serotonin can also be achieved by supplementing
with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), the intermediate molecule in the

regarding whether it is advisable to also supplement vitamin B6 when
taking 5-HTP, and whether an enzyme (decarboxylase) inhibitor should be
taken to delay the conversion of 5-HTP to serotonin to the brain rather
than it taking place predominantly in the bloodstream.]{.calibre7}

[Precursor loading can also work to increase levels of our other
favorite monoamines, acetylcholine and the catecholamines norepinephrine
and dopamine. For instance, L-theanine, found in green tea, can produce
a calming effect by increasing GABA and dopamine in the brain. Then
there's phenylalanine, an amino acid that is converted to tyrosine,
another amino acid, which is in turn converted into the catecholamines
norepinephrine, and dopamine. Low levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine,
norepinephrine and dopamine have all been associated with depression in
humans. Rich sources of phenylalanine include chicken, turkey, fish, soy

shown to accelerate the action of tri-cyclic anti-depressants (such as
Clomicalm and Elavil), one of the difficulties with which has been the
lag (often up to six weeks or more) between commencing therapy and

[This is a fine and fascinating can of worms that you open. Let's
discuss a little of what's known about deception in animals, including
humans, and then circle back to Hannah's behavior. First, a human
example. Linda's office is having a party and she would like her
husband, Joey, to attend it with her. On the afternoon before the party,
Joey complains of not feeling well. Linda ends up going to the party on
her own. While she is gone, Joey watches a football game.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[What are the possible explanations for Joey's behavior? One is that he
is ill. Another is that he actually feels okay but would prefer to not
attend the party and behaves in a way to achieve that end. But it's even
more complicated than that as there are two different ways he can
actually achieve this deceptive end. One is that he thinks it through,
that is, he represents the events, including their likely outcomes, in
his head. "Hmm. I don't want to go, but reneging has social
consequences. However, illness is something beyond my control that Linda
would understand. It is also something I could feign well enough to
deceive her, and everybody would win: she gets to go the party, I get to
stay home, and her feelings aren't hurt." After playing some version of
this plan out in his head, he enacts it. This is intentional deception:
the plan is mentally explored and a decision made before behavior---even
novel behavior without any learning history (important)---occurs. Humans
are very good at this. Dogs, not so much.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Now for deception option two. Joey may have a successful history of
getting off such hooks via illness or appearing ill to others---no
premeditation or intentionality, but a reinforcement history for certain
behaviors in certain contexts. For instance, lying down, looking
reluctant, talking about not feeling 100%, and other related behaviors
may have delayed or prevented unpleasant consequences. Such behavior is
infinitely trainable, in humans, dogs and oodles of other animals. Same
outcome, different mechanism.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[From an outsider's standpoint, it is not possible to tell what is going
on from eyeballing Joey on the day of Linda's party. These mechanisms
function to achieve the same end: Joey looks ill and doesn't attend the
party. Only in intentional deception are there theoretical machinations
in Joey's head, the mental playing out of the scenario in advance, the
one which requires Joey to mentally represent events ahead of time. This
is the one people usually find morally inferior. "Free will" and all
that.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[There is a lot of the other kind---functional deception---in the animal
world. Birds do broken wing displays to lure predators from nests,
possums play possum, cats get down low and stalk. Natural selection has
shaped animals to do these things the same way a trainer and a clicker
can shape a dog to crawl along like a commando, or reinforcement history
shapes helpless or ill-seeming behaviors in people without their
conscious awareness. The behavior works and so is selected for, in one
case, by selecting successively approximating genes over millennia, in
the other by selecting successively approximating behaviors in "real
time." Neither requires the mental gymnastics of intentional
deception.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[So, to summarize: humans are very, very fluent at both evolved in or
conditioned in (functional) deception and intentional deception (which
is also, incidentally, an "evolved in" ability---everything, and I mean
everything, is "evolved in"). We can also do hybrids. A behavior may be
kicked off by a deliberate, intentional deception and then be
conditioned by favorable consequences and get stronger. Or deception may
be initially conditioned and, at some point, reach conscious awareness
and at that point get refined or even self-punished. Or, an intentional
deception that is not successful or punished by an outside agent gets
reduced or dropped from your repertoire. Deception, you see, drives the
evolution of counter-measures in others, resulting in an arms race of
sophistication, which is part of why people have "he's lying" radar as
well as some fancy lying abilities (including, interestingly, the
ability to self-deceive to camouflage lying flags!). Arms races are
compelling selection pressures in nature. Leopard spots and the urge to
station themselves downwind is driven by gazelle eyesight, scenting
ability and vigilance, which drive better spots, and so on.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Dogs, on the other hand, while masterful at being conditioned to behave
in ways that function to get them off hooks, cannot perform intentional
deception the way you and I can. What this means is that Hannah has
likely been successful in the past at ending obedience training or
certain exercises with certain behaviors that you interpret as
malingering. But just because you can do it with intentionality doesn't
mean she can.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[This raises some questions. The most interesting one to me is why
people persist in believing dogs can intentionally deceive the way
humans can in spite of substantial evidence to the contrary. That there
are other ways to achieve the same goal seems to rub many people the
wrong way.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[I think this is because we have profound difficulty imagining different
minds. And we furthermore value or rank animals according to how
similarly their minds are to ours! It is the brain judging equivalent to
evaluating your dog's conformation based on a breed standard consisting
of human movie actors. We readily appreciate dog bodies relative to dog
standards, but when it comes to cognition, the gold standard is
inevitably human. Ironically, part of what makes it difficult for us to
imagine minds that are not like ours is evolutionary pressure that drove
our minds to be able to represent other minds like ours. A significant
element in the early environment of humans was the minds of other
humans, an arms race of Machiavellian navigation. Fast forward to today.
Dogs are family members and so are subject to fast and loose
anthropomorphism.]{.calibre7}

[Another question this raises is why on earth Hannah doesn't want to do
obedience? A careful re-examination of how you are motivating her may be
in order. Finally, I would like to point out that it is entirely
possible that Hannah does have a bona fide physical problem. Dogs with
pain or infirmity routinely rise to hyper-motivating occasions such as
squirrels, so her apparent ability to suddenly get up or appear athletic
may simply mean she's toughing out a real problem when sufficiently
motivated. Squirrels are up there. Part of your job may turn out to be
getting obedience up there.]{.calibre7}

[There is perhaps no hotter topic in dog training than philosophy: how
exactly does one get the job done. There are two ways to examine
philosophy. One is to objectively observe what the trainer does,
especially as far as the provision of consequences---events that occur
after behavior ---and then look at the result on the behavior's
frequency. What is consequence X and does it make behavior Y increase or
decrease in frequency? This is then classified into the quadrants of
operant conditioning.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5

:::

::: calibre17
[The other way to look at training philosophies is to record the
rhetoric used by the trainer herself. What does the dog trainer say she
is doing? The final and most interesting part is to then compare what
the trainer says she is doing with what she is actually
doing.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5

::: calibre17
[Let's look at objective classification first. Many dog trainers don't
think they are employing some subset of the four types of operant
conditioning. But, I contend that they inevitably are and that this is
the most informative way to break down philosophy. The four quadrants in
operant conditioning are:]{.calibre7}

[For all animals, food, water, and sex function as positive reinforcers.
This is because if they don't find food and water reinforcing they die.
You can also put your money on sex as a positive reinforcer because all
organisms that we routinely train are descended from a nearly billion
year unbroken line that had sex at least once. That's a pretty good
genetic track record, so it's a reasonable inference that any given
individual will have inherited the trait.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[By extension, the termination of food, water, and sex, or the loss of
opportunities to gain them, will all function as negative punishers. My
favorite negative punishment example comes from chicken camp, where dog
trainers go to sharpen up their skills by training chickens. One of the
tasks is a visual discrimination. A cardboard triangle, square, and
circle are put down and the chicken is reinforced for pecking the
triangle. The chicken is highly motivated as it is on a closed economy
(100% of the food ration is earned in training), so triangle pecking
spikes dramatically in frequency. The training periods are usually two
minutes long and there may be only half a dozen or so in one day. So
each two minute opportunity to earn food is important to the
chicken.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Here's the negative punishment part. If the chicken pecks the square or
the circle, not only is it not reinforced with food, it's punished by
removal of the triangle, let's say for thirty seconds. So for thirty
seconds out of its two minute training period, the chicken can't peck
the triangle, its only gateway to earning food reinforcement. What this
results in is a chicken who is both hot to peck the triangle and
extremely unlikely to touch the square or circle. Classic negative
punishment.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[Negative reinforcement is something many of us have experienced in the
form of analgesia. Let's say you have a bad headache. You try painkiller
brand number one to no avail. Then brand number two without luck. You
then try brand number three and it relieves the headache. If the next
time you have a headache you reach for brand three right away, you have
experienced negative reinforcement: the termination of the pain and the
increase in the behavior---brand three ingestion---that accomplished
that.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[If you were careless walking down your basement stairs, banged your
head and that is what gave you the headache in the first place, you
might avoid those stairs in the future or avoid walking down them
carelessly. This would be positive punishment. Note that the same
aversive stimulus---the headache---functions as positive punishment when
it starts and as negative reinforcement when it ends, just as the
chicken's food can function as both positive reinforcement when it
starts and negative punishment when it is removed.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[In dog training, food, toys (for some dogs), access to other dogs or
the owner (especially after an absence), and patting and praise are all
things that some trainers use as positive reinforcers by providing them
to increase the frequency of behaviors like coming when called, sitting,
walking nicely on leash, eliminating in the right place, and chewing the
right stuff. Some dog trainers also employ these things in their role as
negative punishers by terminating them to decrease behaviors like
playing roughly, jumping up, and breaking stays. This represents one
objective philosophical divide: the use of positive reinforcement and/or
negative punishment. There are also mini divides with regard to
reinforcer type: some trainers employ certain reinforcers, but object to
the use of others. For instance, praise and patting are used, but not
food. Other trainers use whatever works.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Aversives are things that signal to an animal imminent bodily injury or
death---in other words, they're painful or scary. In dog training, the
most common aversive stimuli are collar jerks, throwing items at the
dog, shaking him, pinning him on his back, loud noises, hitting him,
spraying him with water or with a chemical such as citronella, pinching
his ear, and electric shock. Just as with the initiating and terminating
of food, toys, play, etc., these aversives can be started and stopped.
And, as with some positive reinforcers, there is a range of potency from
dog to dog. Some dogs are sensitive, finding a wide variety and
intensity of attempted aversives painful or scary, while other dogs are
much tougher.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[So another divide among dog trainers is whether they employ aversives
and, to a lesser degree, whether they employ them as positive punishers
to decrease unwanted behavior, as negative reinforcers to increase
desired behaviors (such as an ear-pinch retrieve), or both.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[If you videotape a trainer in action and count the (hopefully
well-timed) consequences she supplies and then note the effect of these
on the frequency of responses, you can calculate which operant quadrants
she uses and how often. A trainer might be 72% positive reinforcement
and 28% negative punishment. Another trainer may be 55% positive
punishment, 40% positive reinforcement and 5% negative reinforcement.
And so on. This ratio may fluctuate depending on which dog is being
trained to do (or not do) which behavior.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Now the fun part. If you then interview the trainer or read
descriptions by the trainer of her training, you are unlikely to get
percentages of operant quadrants utilized broken down by dog and/or
behavior. Some trainers will deny they are using operant conditioning at
all! Instead, the trainer might do one of three things:]{.calibre7}

the energy projection.]{.calibre7}

with fear and---to quote [Whole Dog Journal]{.italic} editor Nancy
Kearns---wary subservience. Less noble this part. So, based on the (if
you think about it) slightly tortured logic of
I-don't-want-to-give-rewards, an abuser must be some kind of paragon and
the relationship he has with his victim the most august of all, as not
only does it not get any turbo charging from rewards, but withstands
rotten treatment. Hmm.]{.calibre7}

[The other fallout of iron-fistedness about rewards is that it leaves
one in a motivational void for anything other than cheap behaviors in
non-distracting environments. Dogs, like all properly functioning living
organisms, don't waste their behavioral dollar. There is no free lunch
in animal training. In the words of applied behavior analyst Dr. Susan
Friedman, "behavior doesn't flow like a fountain; behavior is a tool to
produce consequences." This human craving for the appearance of
altruistic motivation in dogs almost inevitably adulterates
reward-shunning people to the point of resorting to violence or the
threat of violence to get the job done. Very few trainers who sneer at
positive reinforcement types utter statements like, "Well, it's just
that I prefer pain, fear, and intimidation as motivators." They imply
(or directly state) that their dogs "respect" them, perform "for them,"
or have a good "work ethic." Noble schmoble. I admit to having more
respect for trainers who honestly acknowledge that they choose aversive
motivators to train their dog than I do for trainers who threaten and
hurt under the cloak that the only real motivator is their personal
charm or the crafting of some sort of dog super patriot.]{.calibre7}

generous and associating oneself with intrinsically good things does not
cheapen or corrupt relationships. Your dog loving you and having
fabulous associations to the wonderful things you do are not mutually
exclusive. One won't trump the other. They egg each other on, truth be
told. And being violent or threatening toward someone, in whatever
guise, is not character-building. The fact that relationships can and
often hang on in spite of regular delivery of pain, startle, and
intimidation does not make coercion good. And everyone in the behavior
modification field is well aware that it is absolutely possible to
modify and control behavior---of adults, children, babies, dogs, cats,
horses, birds, bunnies, and any animal you can see without a

municipal anti-cruelty statute, the case should have been a slam-dunk.

Some team members swore their dogs knew it was Flyball night long before
being loaded into the car and taken to practice. In one case, an hour or
so before the trip to class, a garbage truck reliably came grumbling
through the neighborhood right outside the family's house. Shortly after
this, the dog would display excitement by barking, trembling, and racing
around. This was well before any more obvious "we're going to Flyball
practice" cues began. Another team dog would head to the door as soon as
the owner changed into jeans and a sweatshirt after coming home from

[There was a third dog who also started hanging around the front door
eagerly between thirty and sixty minutes before leaving for practice.
This one, however, had no identifiable tip-off that we could figure out.
The likelihood was that the passage of time was the tip-off for this
dog. Dogs, like many animals, are fantastically good at estimating time
intervals. If there is any regularity to go on, dogs learn with
startling accuracy the timing of important events to them: owners
arriving home, daily trips to the dog park, meal times, nail-clipping
day, and Flyball practice night.]{.calibre7}

[These are all examples of classical conditioning, the form of learning
whose details were worked out by Ivan Pavlov around the turn of the last
century. Those same details have bored generations of psychology
students in introductory classes, an obligatory rite of passage to
sexier psych courses on fancy aspects of the mind. There's no doubt that
classical conditioning is wildly out of fashion in psychology, but it's
a goldmine for dog owners. It illuminates many of our "why does he\..."
questions and is a royal road to controlling---yes, controlling---our
dogs' opinions of things.]{.calibre7}

:::

[Even in the hard-core dog behavior world, classical conditioning is
usually muscled out of the way by its flashier cousin, operant
conditioning. Operant conditioning is the science of reward and
punishment and all the fascinating detail of exactly how dogs behave to
get more of the former and less of the latter. Classical conditioning is
the grim science of the inevitable. In classical conditioning dogs learn
tip-offs to important events, and though they can't do anything to
increase or decrease the likelihood of these events, they can prepare
themselves: brace themselves if something rotten is coming up, and get a
head start on, say, cheeriness or digestive juices if something fabulous
or tasty is on the way.]{.calibre7}

[I use the term "tip-off" deliberately. Teachers of classical
conditioning often try to engage student intuition with the word
"association." The dog forms "associations" between vet waiting rooms
and vaccinations, between the upper pantry and cookies, and between
hands reaching for his collar and being yelled at. A vital element needs
underscoring in these examples: the predictive order of events. Vet
waiting rooms come before vaccinations, the owner goes to the pantry
before producing cookies, and the collar grab precedes the punishment.
The order matters. It's just not good enough for one thing to happen
"around the same time" of another thing. One has to reliably predict the
other. Tip-offs to events that have already happened aren't very
advantageous. No use bracing yourself for something that's already come
and gone or, for that matter, is already here. The only tip-off worth
learning is one that lets you know what is about to happen.]{.calibre7}

## [ [The Rules]{.bold1} ]{.calibre24} {#Oh_Behave_Do-mack_to_Pinker_split_035.html#calibre_pb_34 .calibre23}

::: calibre12
 
:::

::: calibre17
[So, the first rule of classical conditioning is to ensure the thing
you're trying to condition the dog to love or hate comes first. If you
want your dog to like Fed Ex deliveries more, go to the pantry and
produce cookies after the Fed Ex man comes. Not before and not at the
instant he arrives. After. Fed Ex deliveries thus gain predictive value.
The order of events is an area where our intuitions can fail us. Partly
this is an unfortunate by-product of the way classical conditioning is
often taught to undergraduates---using the phrase "forming
associations," which is not quite accurate enough. Remember: Pavlovian
conditioning is more about anticipation, animals learning tip-offs to
important events by virtue of their predictive value. Tip-offs aren't
useful during or after, only before. The first event in a classical
conditioning procedures says "here it comes\..." and the second event is
It.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The next rule for good conditioning is getting as close as you can to a
one to one ratio of event one (delivery man) to event two (cookies). If
the delivery man only predicts cookies half the time, conditioning will
be weaker. If the non-cookie half happens when the owner is not home,
the dog will learn this clause and thus feel warm and fuzzy and salivary
when the delivery man comes and the owner is home, and much less so when
the delivery man comes and the owner is not home. Dogs are very good at
Specific Case.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The third rule for robust conditioning is narrowing the dog's focus to
exactly what you want conditioned. Just as you feel smug that your dog
has gone from territorial frenzy to wagging cookie anticipation, you
discover the dog still hates (or is non-committal about) Fed Ex
employees, but now loves people with clipboards! The real world is
messier than psychology laboratories and dogs often selectively attend
to---from our perspective---the wrong bits. To raise our chances of
their attending to the right bits, a crafty trainer will break rule two
for the wrong bits by proving to the dog in day-to-day life that
clipboards predict nothing. As clipboards routinely appear before
dog-dull activities such as watching TV or computing, the dog is more
likely to go on uniformed strangers as the cookie tip-off when the Fed
Ex man returns. So it's worth time thinking about whether there are any
screamingly obvious things (to the dog) that might steal the thunder
from your project. The usual suspects, competition-wise, are Big
Stimuli---like smells---and elements in the training set-up that the dog
has prior experience with---bait pouches, containers, the "I'm training
you now" look, etc.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Finally, bear in mind that Murphy's Law dictates that all three of
these rules for strong conditioning will align perfectly when we don't
want conditioning at all. For example, dogs with separation anxiety
usually start unraveling while the owner is preparing to leave for work.
The dog trembles, pants, paces, or hides while the owner dons work
clothes, packs a briefcase, and picks up keys. The reason for the dog's
behavior is that the rules of conditioning have been dumbly followed: 1)
the get-ready-for-work ritual comes before the owner's departure, giving
it tip-off value; 2) the ritual is strongly correlated with being alone,
giving it close to a one to one ratio; and 3) the ritual occurs while
the owner is still home, resulting in the dog focusing on the right bit
(the owner's activities) from a conditioning perspective, though of
course the wrong bit from our perspective. Because such dogs feel
anxious before the owner departs, separation anxiety treatment protocols
must be broadened to incorporate desensitization to these learned
tip-offs to aloneness.]{.calibre7}

:::

::: calibre17
[There are three ways to get classical conditioning to work for rather
than against you. The first is to make a list of things you'd like to
manufacture a favorable opinion about in your dog and start ensuring
these things predict meals, cookies, walks, and play. For example, don't
just brush your puppy; brush him briefly before every walk. Pack cookies
(or, even better, beef jerky) on your walks and, every time your dog
meets a child or hears a loud noise, provide a cookie afterwards. Rather
than simply feeding your dog twice a day, grab his collar and then
prepare and offer his dinner.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The second way to exploit Pavlovian principles is called
"counter-conditioning." Let's say that rather than having no particular
opinion about being brushed, your dog hates it. Adding a brush-out
before walks is not just conditioning any more: it's counter-acting an
existing strong opinion. Counter-conditioning is often done in
conjunction with desensitization, e.g., doing two or three light brush
strokes before walks for a week, then five or six for a week, then five
or six vigorous strokes for two weeks, all the way up to an entire (and
happy) brushing in front of the walk.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Plain conditioning is usually easier than counter-conditioning: an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Puppies are thus
opportunities. List everything you'd like your puppy to like as an adult
and condition each one while he's still a puppy. Likewise, "first
impressions" for adult dogs are also opportunities. Dogs are
attentive---at least briefly---to new stuff. Capitalize on this. Imagine
the dog asking, on first trips to the groomer, first car rides, and
first collar grabs: "hmm, this is new---what does it mean?" Then answer
the question: "it means cookies!" Indelible in many cases.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The final way of getting classical conditioning to work for rather than
against you is the "don't lie" rule. If you're about to bathe your dog
and your dog hates baths, it's relationship suicide to approach the
unsuspecting victim saying "it's okay, it's ooookaaaaay" and then bathe
him. Yes, you were able to easily catch him, but you also made your
approach (or possibly "it's okay") a tip-off to bad news. If it's going
to be bad news, signal bad news. "Bath time" said in a deadpan tone may
send the dog running but, more importantly, you have protected yourself,
your approach, and your soothing tone from unwanted
conditioning.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[It's also helpful to break things down into manageable chunks, to avoid
elements in grooming that are likely to be intrinsically unpleasant. For
instance, build just being in the tub up with some conditioning before
doing the first bath. Do a few trials on the sound of the water. Do some
on pretend (dry) "lathering." Separate foot restraint from the
nail-clipping implement before clipping nails. Reeeeeally try hard to
not hit the quick the first few times you actually trim. Likewise, do
brush touches first and separately from restraint. Time invested in a
new puppy can set her up for a lifetime of not just tolerating, but
feeling happy and relaxed, during grooming.]{.calibre7}

This hasn't shaken the most zealous in either camp from their biases

[This last bit, about the unlearned leading to the learned, or to a
prompt, is critically important but sometimes omitted by dog trainers.
Although we are discussing operant conditioning---animals learning about
the relationship between their behavior and its consequences---the
relationship between a cue and a prompt is a classical relationship. The
first stimulus, the new cue to be learned, is in the conditioned
stimulus "slot" and the prompt, or known cue is in the second,
unconditioned stimulus "slot." If the first event---new cue---reliably
predicts the second event---prompt or already learned cue---classical
conditioning will occur and the animal will start to anticipate the
second event and deliver up the operant behavior before the second
event. Trainers refer to this as the dog "jumping the prompt." It feels
to the trainer as though the dog is cutting to the chase---performing
the behavior ASAP in order to get to the reinforcement part. If you say
"sit" to your hand-signal trained dog, wait a second and then deliver
the hand signal, he will, over time, stop waiting for the signal and
start sitting as soon as he hears the verbal "sit."]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[If cues and prompts are presented at the same time (or
backwards---prompt first and then cue), the cue will not be learned.
This is one of the straw man arguments I talked about earlier. Learning
is not blocked or overshadowed by using prompts in training. Learning of
new cues can be blocked or overshadowed by presenting new cues
simultaneous to prompts or already learned cues, but this is an error
only an extremely neophyte trainer would make when using a prompt. By
analogy, no one would take seriously a contention that clicker training
is useless when the arguer's version of "clicker training" is the
presentation of treat first, then click, so the contention that food
lures block or overshadow learning or cues, based on a rudimentary
technical error should be similarly dismissed.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[More often than simply waiting for classical conditioning to occur,
trainers deliberately fade prompts. It is considered prudent practice to
start fading as soon as the dog performs readily for the lure and to
fade gradually. For example, after three or four times prompting a
recall with a staccato, trilling sound, clapping hands and a crouch, the
trainer might move to a semi-crouch for a few repetitions. If
performance remains strong, every few repetitions she might reduce first
the hand clapping, then drop the crouching altogether, then drop the
hand clapping altogether, then reduce the vocal prompt in stages,
culminating in a dog that comes enthusiastically for a bare verbal cue,
"come!" Unstated here is that these performances for faded prompts are
still being reinforced, i.e., some sort of intrinsically valuable event,
such as a food treat, initiation of a walk or tug game, is provided
after the dog comes. Failure to do so represents a problem of too-weakly
conditioned behavior, not a problem with the prompt. Focusing on
specific antecedent events, such as prompts, does not exempt a trainer
from the consequence end of things. Once again, poor execution of basic
training procedure is at the root, not the use of prompting.]{.calibre7}

[As for problem solving ability in dogs, this term needs to be better
defined, let alone researched, before anyone, including me and including
anti-lure types, can make fair statements about it being reduced by the
use of lures in training. It also bears mentioning that in the pet dog
training arena, the development of "problem solving skills" in the dog
may not always be a priority objective.]{.calibre7}

to eliminate prompts from the dog training field.]{.calibre7}

of shaping by successive approximation. This is a technique whose rules
have been well laid out by uber-trainers such as Bob Bailey or in books
such as Karen Pryor's [Don't Shoot the Dog,]{.italic} but that also can
prove fiendishly difficult. I'd say the difficulties stem from two
sources: 1) the all-too human tendency to break the rules, and 2) the
necessity of keeping track of criteria. Those same components that allow
ready break-down of heeling into nice, smooth criteria steps, can
overwhelm a trainer who isn't either naturally well organized or keeps
detailed training records. Let's look at the rules and how they apply to

:::

::: calibre5

:::

::: calibre17
[The optimal standard to set is one where the trainer never "loses" the
dog (dog quits trying), but that maximizes incremental progress toward
the final goal behavior. It's all about efficiency. Setting criteria too
high results in frustration at best and constantly losing the dog at
worst, necessitating having to get him back to the game with ultra-easy
repetitions and a re-build to where you left off. Setting criteria too
low results in wheel-spinning. The dog cranks out the same old behavior,
often in a minimalist fashion, and progress is slow or
non-existent.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[So, a good place to start is knowing how long between reinforcers your
dog can tolerate before he quits and always set your rate of
reinforcement so that he never quits. There has been some convergence by
systematic trainers on the idea of ten reinforcers per minute as a
default rate for a green animal learning a new behavior. This comes to
reinforcement every six seconds, which may be partial explanation for
why your puppy is falling apart on a new behavior reinforced every ten
seconds. The final goal is likely to contain a duration requirement of a
minute or two, but this parameter will build more smoothly when Brad has
a sturdier heel.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[So a good trainer will determine criteria based on optimal rate of
reinforcement. The question therefore is not "what behavior is the dog
already offering," but "what behavior is the dog already offering at the
rate of reinforcement I'm after." It helps to arrive at this call to
think about parameters.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre12

[Parameters are the different pieces that make up a criterion. For
example, heeling has position, duration, eye contact (if desired),
automatic sits and how well they are executed (i.e., how straight), take
offs after sits, turns, pace changes, and the conditions and degree of
distraction under which the dog must perform. At any given moment in
heeling, each of these parameters will be at a certain level. And,
remember, the key to good shaping is optimal rate of reinforcement,
which means sample-driven criteria with clear articulation of what
degree of difficulty of each parameter must be achieved for the dog to
be reinforced. In a complex behavior such as heeling, this usually means
keeping track of your parameters. Failing to do so easily results in
what's called a "criteria pile-up," where the trainer inadvertently
raises difficulty on more than one parameter at the same
time.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Here's an example. Let's say you've got Brad to the point where he will
heel in a straight line in a quiet location with perfect position and
eye contact for a duration of eight seconds for five out of five
practice trials. And let's say on your training agenda for this week is
to get your sits automatic, get right and about turns up and running
with correct position, and extend duration to fifteen seconds. When
working your automatic sit parameter, if Brad's sits are automatic half
the time without a verbal cue on straight-line heeling with
reinforcement every eight seconds, and you do stretches of heeling that
are eight seconds long and then halt, Brad will get reinforced
approximately every sixteen seconds---for half the time when he sits
automatically. You will lose him and possibly feel shortchanged as
you're only demanding eight second stretches of heeling. What's missing
is criteria that support an adequate rate of reinforcement, which for
Brad at his current level is every eight seconds. To get the sits
automatic, drop the duration requirement on the heeling. Heel him for
four second bursts to maintain your every-eight-second rate. Once he's
nailing the automatic sits every time, you can bring the duration back
in. If you wanted to continue to use your verbal cue, when you halt,
give him a second to sit. If he doesn't, say "sit" and don't
reinforce---reinforce only the sits that didn't need a verbal cue. The
sit cue comes after the halt so that halting predicts the learned cue.
Brad's anticipation rate will go up and you can drop the verbal. And
don't forget to keep the duration component at four seconds to avoid
tanking your rate.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[When you decide to work on duration, keep the heeling simple and build
the time gradually. Don't add back any other features---turns, halts,
etc.---until he can do long straight-aways. When you start migrating to
distracting locations, drop all other requirements as you'll have much
more competition for his behavior dollar.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[This process of back-burnering other criteria parameters when raising
level of difficulty on one usually requires keeping written training
records for complex behaviors to avoid criteria pile-ups. When
individual parameters are perfected, you can start combining toward your
finished product.]{.calibre7}

[Part of the reason shaping is so engrossing an activity for both
trainer and dog is its complexity. Most dogs seem to relish the puzzle
solving aspect. This is unsurprising when you think about it. Working
for parsed out rations is ideal mental stimulation for a species whose
ancestors not long ago had to solve problems---i.e., hunting and
successfully scavenging---in order to eat. For trainers, it can be a
test of technical mettle to learn and apply the rules. What has always
interested me most about shaping is how often the rules go out the
window in the heat of training, especially if the trainer has an
emotional investment in the dog being trained. This most often crops up
when one is training one's own dog. So, when things do not go swimmingly
during shaping, one of the first culprits to consider is whether the
trainer is breaking one of those basic rules I described earlier. Have
another skilled trainer observe your session and/or your training notes
to see if they can lend objective eyes to your adherence to the
basics.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre12
 
:::

::: calibre17
[One fabulously well understood technical skill is the trainer's timing.
This is the latency (lag) between the dog's execution (often the start
of his execution) of the desired response and the delivery of
reinforcement---or the signaling of impending reinforcement---to the
dog. Because dogs are not privy to human consensus that sitting is
better than scratching or that watching is better than sniffing, and
because dog behavior passes rapidly, it behooves the trainer to
precisely reinforce desired responses rather than responses that happen
one or more seconds later. Imagine playing a "you're getting warmer
game" with someone who told you that you were getting warmer whenever
you moved slightly away from the target location and then became
frustrated at your apparent agenda to thwart their training efforts. Or
sent you for a medical work-up to diagnose a presumed learning
disability.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The gold medal timing upgrader is the clicker. It allows the trainer to
mark behavior for reinforcement at a distance and with terrific
precision. It divorces dogs from pocket-watching or monitoring flinches
toward bait pouches, thus enabling them to move their bodies---including
their sensory apparatus---more freely and never miss a click. While
clickers do not solve training problems like low rate of reinforcement
or poor criteria setting, they are powerful tools to improve
timing.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Deliver a primary reinforcer after every click: the relationship
between the click and the treat is a classical one. There are no
intermittent schedules in classical conditioning, only weaker
conditioning. Click only when you are going to deliver a primary
reinforcer. So, if a dog is on a variable ratio one out of three for
"down," the two out of three downs that are unreinforced receive neither
a click nor a primary reinforcer. Clicks don't mean "correct behavior,"
they mean "here comes a primary reinforcer." Every time you click
without treating you weaken the charge on the clicker. There is no good
reason to do this. If you wish to distinguish wrong responses from
correct responses that are part of an intermittent schedule, develop a
system to differentiate these. For instance, mark wrong responses with a
signal such as "not quite" or "wrong" and say nothing for correct
responses that are to be unreinforced due to the schedule. Or say
nothing on wrong responses and mark correct responses with "good one,"
which means "that is the response---enough of those and you will be
reinforced."]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Clickers don't automatically give you superb timing. Clicks are often
late and occasionally early. If you find yourself in the same shaping
ruts again and again, consider videotaping yourself to evaluate your
timing, or training with a coach whose job it is to monitor timing. The
maxim is: you don't get what you want, you get what you
click.]{.calibre7}

argued that they are over-rated and over-used in practical animal
training. For those of us who were taught about resilience to extinction

[One time where an intermittent schedule---i.e., partial
extinction---can be exploited strategically is when there is a genuine
lack of variability in the range of responses being offered. To break
the stereotyped and overly efficient style in the dog, an intermittent
schedule invites variability of response, as though the dog were asking,
"hmm---I used to be reinforced for this all the time but now I'm not---I
wonder what it is about the ones I am being reinforced for---if I could
figure that out, I could be reinforced all the time again" and then
experiments. Voila: variability from which to select new criteria. This
is not a strategy to overuse. It works best when increased vigor or
intensity of responding is desired. Responses can also extinguish
altogether. If you find yourself resorting to partial extinction a lot,
it's time to re-examine your basic technique. Most shaping projects on
most dogs will not require this.]{.calibre7}

[There is a fiendishly clever and theoretically elegant solution to this
type of problem. The catch is it's a very tricky orchestration job.
Let's go through the theory first and then some nuts and bolts of the
messy execution in your case.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[David Premack is a psychologist who re-framed the concept of
reinforcement as the opportunity to engage in a preferred response
rather than the provision of a reinforcing thing, i.e.,"eating is a
reinforcing activity," rather than "food is a reinforcer." He also
pointed out that the capacity of these behaviors to be reinforcing is
relative, depending on the difference between the actual and preferred
level of responding. What this means is that eating a turkey sandwich is
likely to be extremely reinforcing if you haven't eaten for a couple of
days, whereas eating a turkey sandwich minutes after over-eating on
Thanksgiving is less likely to be a reinforcing event. Sleeping, taking
a walk, or sitting in a chair watching TV are more likely to be
reinforcing activities after eating a massive turkey dinner, but under
other conditions might have lower value. And so on. More than one astute
student has rightly pointed out to me that "it's all Premack" in dog
training, meaning all reinforcement contingencies can be explained in
Premacky terms.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Eyeballing an organism and guessing what the gold, silver, and bronze
level activities are is impossible. You can, however, measure the
relative frequencies of various behaviors when an animal has
unrestricted access to engage in certain activities. The activities can
then be ranked from high probability to low probability, depending on
how much the animal does. The relative frequencies, as expected, will
shift with shifting deprivation levels.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The most interesting part for us dog people is that the frequency of
the lower probability behaviors can be boosted at any time by making the
high probability behaviors contingent on them. Most kids wouldn't eat
their broccoli (low probability behavior in the free operant baseline of
a five year old), if they could cut directly to the ice cream (high
probability behavior). So, as long as you know the order at any given
time, you can manipulate frequencies. If you eat broccoli first, then
you may eat ice cream.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Dog trainers have heard the maxim "turn the distraction into a reward."
The sub-text of this is that what we label "distractions" in dog
training are actually motivators that are trumping the motivators we
wish to employ. From the dog's point of view, these are not
"distractions" at all. As a matter of fact, to a dog that is trying to
investigate the rear of another dog, the trainer (waving food or yanking
on a leash) is the distraction!]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Now for the messy application part. The objective with Norman is that
he refrain from attacking your household goods (low probability
behavior), in order to get to attack your household goods (high
probability behavior). The first dicey bit is your willingness to grant
the motivator, at least often enough to maintain the polite refraining.
If you never, ever want him to do these things, even in short bursts at
times you specify, then Premack's Principle can't be exploited. Granting
access is often a prohibitive consideration in predation situations.
Take squirrel chasing. Sometimes the squirrel gets a sufficient head
start if the dog does a recall before being granted opportunity to
chase, but sometimes chasing is unacceptable in any form to the owner
and/or there are other safety considerations such as traffic, or animals
being skunks and porcupines rather than squirrels.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[If you think you might be willing to give him short, cued bursts of
attacking the sheets and vacuum, then the next issue is engineering it
so that he cannot directly access these activities unless he has first
done some polite, waiting behavior. At first, I suggest that you require
from him only a short pause, an impulse control droplet, in order to
grant him an attack. Then, very gradually, crank it up until he must do
impressive amounts of polite down-stay to get brief bursts of attack
reward. Imagine, if you will, consuming five or six servings of broccoli
in order to get a tablespoon of your favorite ice-cream.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[So, how to get those early impulse control droplets so he can dope out
the rules to the broccoli-ice-cream game? First, proof an impulse
control behavior, e.g., down-stay, until it is very sturdy around normal
distractions such as food dropped in front of him, etc. He was top of
his obedience class, so this part may already be in place. The next step
is to introduce the vacuum. Because the down-stay is likely to be null
set around it, and Norman needs to be set up to succeed at this early
on, I recommend mechanically preventing him from screwing up by
harnessing or holding him. This is admittedly clunky but it gets the job
done. Use as little mechanical restraint as possible, partly because
this can be agitating around a prey-type stimulus and partly because we
want to monitor for any droplets of self-imposed impulse control. This
first session may require two people, one to vacuum or move bed sheets
and one to restrain and monitor Norman. It helps the cause to do the
least provocative vacuuming or sheet moving possible.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Proceed to put Norman in his down-stay. The designated vacuumer then
does a bit of vacuuming. If he lunges, the vacuuming ceases and the
trainer/restrainer stops him and re-commences the down-stay. Repeat.
Once he holds his stay, even a little, praise enthusiastically and then
say "okay, GET IT!" and let him have four or five seconds of gleeful
play. Then, tell him "out" or "enough" and re-commence from the
down-stay. Most dogs get worse immediately after they sample the
reinforcer a couple of times---this is fine. Persevere. In a few more
repetitions, most dogs begin more keenly holding their down-stays, rapt
and waiting for the "okay, GET IT!" cue.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Once he's good at it, re-training for each problem scenario goes faster
as the task is sufficiently similar. You can even use this same
reinforcing activity to sharpen up other obedience commands.]{.calibre7}

[A ringwise dog has learned the difference between training and
performance events. Although the exercises are the same for both and
many of the context elements are the same---mats, jumps, scent articles,
etc., there are enough differences to allow the dog to form a
discrimination between the two. Once this discrimination is formed, the
dog will respond to each depending on the learning contingencies each
predict.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Why do animals have this discrimination capability? The answer is
efficiency and, often, survival. Behavior must be orderly. Animals that
employ "shotgun" approaches, one-size-fits-all responses featuring
little or no match between behavior and context, are out-reproduced by
animals whose repertoires include precise calculation regarding what to
do when. I bet, for instance, that you don't try to walk straight lines
and do square corners with precise footwork when you're on your way to
work.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Animals also need to discriminate context to formulate motivational
priorities when there is more than one option (i.e., pretty much all the
time). If you're a prey species, for example, it would be maladaptive to
dither between eating and anti-predator responses, such as flight, in
the context of an approaching predator ("this is a particularly sweet
patch of grass; I think I'll grab just a few more mouthfuls
and\...aaaaaaiiiiiiieeeeee\..."). Animals with poor discrimination of
context more often fail to contribute their genetic legacy to future
generations. And so, good, adaptive motivational prioritizing evolved,
and it depends utterly on context discrimination. Zebras don't try to
drink the grass. Lions don't try to mate with trees (or zebras). And, in
a learning situation, rather than acquiring a general case rule whenever
they learn something, animals often code context cues to help them
decide when to trot out which learned behavior. Which brings us to your
girl.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre5

::: calibre17
[Beatrice has learned that it pays---either to avoid punishment or
obtain reinforcers, depending on your particular training tribe---to
heel, sit, jump on cue, and do go-outs in the context of a training
class or practice session. She has also learned that it does not pay,
i.e., there are no behavior-consequence contingencies, to do these
behaviors in a trial context. Trial contexts are quite particular.
There's a high density of middle-aged women in polyester skirts and
tennis shoes---a dead give-away for the fashion-conscious
dog---clipboards, crowds, adrenalin, and human and dog stress hormones
in the air. Ring barriers (curtains, baby-gates), stewards with nametags
barking out numbers, and time spent waiting in crates complete the
picture.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[It's extremely important to note that there is no conscious agenda on
Beatrice's part. In spite of deeply held trainer suspicions, dogs do not
estimate the cost in entry fees and travel of an obedience trial and
then craftily offer up lackluster performance as retribution for an
abbreviated fetch game the previous week. A human might very well alter
their behavior for these sorts of motives. Machinations based on
theory-of-mind---e.g., I know you think I believe you were lying
yesterday---are one of the strong suits of human cognition. Humans are
prone to theory of mind misfires at dogs (who are, after all, Honorary
Humans). These, combined with the human talent for reciprocal
altruism---the evolutionary root of The Golden Rule---can make for a lot
of wildly entertaining and oh-so human just-so stories about why dogs do
what they do at obedience trials.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The bottom line is that, at an obedience trial, sitting straight,
snappy retrieves, and sharp heeling don't result in the same
consequences as they do in a training context. Motivational mileage can
be obtained in the case of a dog that finds one or more of the tasks
intrinsically reinforcing (e.g., Border Collies living to retrieve) and
so not all dogs' performances deteriorate in the same way or even at
all. When self-reinforcing features are absent, extrinsic
motivators---or their glaring absence---will come to control
performance.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[It takes time for the dog's brain to dope out the rule---there are no
rewards and/or punishments in the ring at obedience trials, but
still/always rewards and/or punishments in training class---and behave
efficiently. This accounts for the often-seen phenomenon of gradual
deterioration over time, which is what you are reporting in
Beatrice.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[To reduce this effect, I have two suggestions. The first is to blur the
distinction between the two. Add as many trial-type elements to your
training picture as possible. The best way to do this is to go to
matches, as you've been advised, provided you train at the match, i.e.,
provide rewards and/or punishments. For most dogs, matches are adequate
trial simulators. Continue entering and training at matches---train just
as you would in a training class---until performance has maxed out. This
brings us to suggestion two, which is to avoid entering trials until the
dog's performance is 1) as flawless as you can make it in matches, and
2) resilient to extinction. This means that you can, in training class
or, more importantly, at a match, do the entire routine trial-style,
from start to finish (with reinforcement at the very end, on exiting the
ring, for instance), without rewards and/or punishers and without
detectable flaws in performance.]{.calibre7}

[Some trainers work around the no-feedback-in-the-ring problem by
developing legal conditioned reinforcers that signal mid-routine that
rewards will be supplied to the dog post-routine. A word or phrase,
which has been conditioned over weeks and months to predict food, a
favorite game or unabashed affection, can serve as a "you're on the
right track, reward is coming soon" and help maintain
performance.]{.calibre7}

[A fine trainer and good friend of mine "specializes" in deaf dogs,
offering, for instance, one free consult to anyone who rescues a deaf
dog. I say "specialize" in quotations because he has made it abundantly
clear to me that the principles of training a deaf dog are no different
from those of training a dog who can hear. He is continually surprised,
in fact, by how even experienced dog people go belly up when presented
with a deaf dog, as though they must learn in a completely different
way.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[Deaf dogs, like normal dogs, learn from the immediate consequences of
their actions. For example, a deaf dog will learn that coming to the
owner in the dog park results 96% of the time in the leash being put on
and the end of play. Being a properly functioning living organism, the
dog learns to avoid the owner when called at the park. He can also learn
that coming to the owner at the park results 85% of the time in a small
treat and being sent back for more play, 10% of the time in nothing in
particular, and 5% of the time in going home. In this case the dog is
likely to have a strong recall. Dogs---including deaf dogs---do what
works.]{.calibre7}

`</span>`{=html}
:::

::: calibre17
[Of these, the priorities are to teach Magic to watch you and to have a
sterling recall. The most efficient first exercise combines watch with
the establishment of a conditioned reinforcer. Before starting, decide
what signal you're going to use to mark right responses: the "that exact
behavior gets you a reward" signal. Most deaf dog trainers use a thumbs
up gesture. Like all the visual cues, make sure it is clear and distinct
from other hand movements you might use in everyday life. Get a supply
of small, tasty treats and stand with Magic in a low distraction
environment (somewhere in your house is fine). Stand still and wait,
paying close attention. The instant Magic makes eye contact with you,
even for a fleeting instant, give your thumbs up sign and then
immediately deliver one treat. Then stand and wait for the next one. A
sharp trainer will capture every instance of eye contact, which greatly
accelerates learning. If you're crafty about catching every instance of
eye contact and your timing is good, Magic will soon be quickly
"recycling," which is trainer-speak for re-initiating eye contact
immediately after being paid (treated) for the previous response. The
behavior, which used to seem to occur by chance, now looks more
deliberate. When Magic is recycling eye contact as fast as you can pay
him for it, start delaying your thumbs up sign and payment for a second
or two. The idea now is to gradually build duration of eye contact. Work
your way up to five or ten seconds, only increasing the duration when he
is recycling immediately.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The next step is to take your fledgling watch on the road. Re-teach the
exercise in different rooms of your house, in the yard, in front of your
house, with you at a bit of a distance, etc. Every slight variation may
initially throw him for a loop, so be patient. This generalizing is well
worth the effort if your goal is a nice, durable behavior. Once Magic is
proficient in a variety of low distraction environments, practice around
people and, finally, dogs. Outdoor coffee shops, in dog training
classes, and in parks are excellent spots. Usually the standard has to
be dropped back to that used in initial training (brief, fleeting
watches) when increasing the distraction. Once the behavior is being
recycled quickly, build back to your five or ten seconds.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Now it's time to add your "watch" cue so Magic knows when to do it.
Decide what the cue will be. A common choice is a finger point to your
eyes. Go back to inside the house. First, give the cue, then wait for
the behavior and reinforce as usual. Repeat several times. Then, do not
give the cue for a minute or so. During this no-cue period, ignore any
eye contact from Magic. Then, give the cue and commence rewarding again.
The nice strong behavior you've built should rebound nicely from the
temporary wobbling it got when you stopped paying. Alternate these two
conditions---no cue, no payment; if cue, payment for behavior---over and
over until Magic gets the message: the behavior only works when the cue
is on, like in the game Simon Says. This gives your cue
value.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[To teach a recall, first decide what the cue will be. Many trainers
employ vibrating collars. A great web site,
[www.deafdogs.org](http://www.deafdogs.org){.calibre8}, lists the
available models, including the products' range, whether they are
waterproof, lightweight, have a tone feature that would aid the handler
in locating an AWOL dog and, importantly, whether the collar also can
deliver shock. You don't need the shock feature. Electric shock---a
sensation quite distinct from vibration---is not a desirable part of any
animal's education. Just like in the previous exercise, train in a
variety of low distraction environments before re-training around
distractions. Increase the distance or move to a new location only when
the behavior is performed with near 100% reliability. Start up close (a
few feet away), using the following sequence:]{.calibre7}

::: calibre26
::: calibre27
> [1. vibrate the collar]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre27
> [2. after (not during) the vibration, encourage Magic to approach you

:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

`</span>`{=html}
:::

::: calibre17
[One of the first signs of proficiency will be Magic not waiting for the
prompt (#2) but rather charging directly to you as soon as you vibrate
the collar. When he's reliable and no longer waiting for prompts,
commence your distance building and distraction-proofing
efforts.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[Max's stellar off leash play history and wild man antics on leash
strongly suggest that he is experiencing barrier frustration. Let's
first gain some understanding of exactly what barrier frustration is and
then get into how you might be able to dial it down.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[We've all experienced frustration, a suite of emotions and behaviors in
response to externally imposed limits. Psychologists studying
frustration usually refer to concepts like the blocking of goal-directed
behavior or the cessation of expected rewards. A car that suddenly won't
start, a photocopier that jams when you're in a rush, and a spouse that
changes the channel in the middle of a critical moment in your favorite
TV show, all might elicit acute aggression in you.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Research on a wide variety of animals has shown again and again that
frustration can elicit aggression. One psychologist in the 1930s went so
far as to suggest that all aggression was frustration related! Nobody
thinks this anymore, but there is good consensus these days that
frustration can directly cause aggression and that the mechanism may be
in the serotonin system in the brain. Medications that reduce
impulsivity also mitigate aggression in response to frustration,
suggesting a link between frustration-induced aggression and impulse
control in general. It's also been found that within a species
individuals will differ in the degree to which they respond to
frustration with aggression. This certainly aligns with the observations
of dog people. In what appear to be similarly frustrating situations,
some dogs display signs of stress, but without aggression, some put on
impressive aggressive displays, and some are utterly
phlegmatic.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Dogs also seem to differ with regard to how impulsive they are, i.e.,
how hair-trigger they are in response to attractive environmental
elements in general: smells, other dogs, people, ice cream on the
sidewalk, critters, etc. Intensity and impulsivity are not the same
thing. Intensity is partly a function of impulse control, but also of
degree of motivation. A dog may be highly motivated by cats and so, in
spite of otherwise great impulse control, lose it when he spots a cat.
And a dog who is not necessarily off the charts motivationally may lack
impulse control and so have zero lag between perceiving things and
charging up to them.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Motivation can be cranked up with deprivation. Dogs and people become
incredibly interesting to sociable dogs who are isolated for long
periods. Chronic isolation situations can be very agitating. For
example, long-term confinement to a backyard with a view of passers-by
will often (and ironically) produce aggressive displays in what would
otherwise be a friendly dog. Dogs with predispositions to guard when on
the owner's property may also display at intruders, and so it's
important in an individual case to ascertain whether a displaying dog is
highly social and so primarily frustrated, or less social with strangers
and therefore primarily guarding.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[In Max's case, we're putting our money on frustration. My bet is he has
some combination of strong motivation for dogs, possibly combined with
impulsivity and, importantly, a tendency to respond to frustration with
aggression. His behavior has nothing to do with being "spoiled." In
fact, if you ceased your regular dog park outings, it's quite possible
Max will get even worse on leash due to the more extreme dog
deprivation. Barrier frustration is not at all a function of proximity
to your home either. The worst cases of barrier frustration in fact are
typically in kennels, where dogs are away from home (and far from
spoilt). Kenneled dogs are, however, in a relatively static, barren
environment, which increases their motivation to meet and investigate
dogs and people, and over and over, they get to perceive (see, hear,
smell) them, but can't fully and freely investigate. This frustrates
many of the dogs and a percentage of these have the "respond to
frustration with display" chip.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[If you think about the lives of many dogs, there is an impressive
amount of physical thwarting of strongly motivated behavior. Dog life is
a continuous series of walls, fences, leashes, crates, and commands. Of
course it's neither safe nor practical to allow free behavior all the
time, but one way to reduce the load that might lead to barrier
frustration in a susceptible dog is to mitigate these situations where
possible. For example, if Max encounters a dog on his walk that he has
demonstrated good off-leash relations with, try to pre-empt his
displaying by hustling him over for an instant, motivation-deflating
on-leash meet and greet on the street. Even better, do several in a row
with that same dog, to practice manners. The first one, even if it ends
up fraught with fireworks that will dissipate once Max has made contact,
i.e., once the frustration is ended. The second one is likely to be a
non-event: the "oh, you again" effect. This gives you a chance to praise
and reward Max for doing exactly what you'd like more of in the future.
Polite behavior on leash around other dogs. It helps to have a clearly
defined behavior in mind to reward, such as "sit and watch me" or "walk
by nicely" or even "approach dog without barking or growling." It also
helps a great deal to use potent rewards: pack small, tasty food rewards
for just such encounters. Praise and then feed good
performances.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[As Max gets more polished at this new game, you may start to get better
results on even first tries with these familiar dogs. Continue to reward
when he gets it right. If this becomes fluent you may start to see
better behavior even around novel dogs. Consistently rewarding this will
cause it to increase in frequency until, with some luck, it becomes his
default.]{.calibre7}

[A fantabulous trend is the use of professional dog walkers, who break
up the dog's day with a trip out, usually to a (safe) off-leash area

the likelihood of behavior problems stemming from under-stimulation
(i.e., boredom), it gives the dog a mid-day potty break. While there is

minutes of fetch or Frisbee™ time at the local dog park or brisk
walking. It really needs to be daily, so figure out what works and do
it. If you opt for walkies, make sure it's long (thirty or more minutes)
and that the dog gets to sniff stuff, to provide mental stimulation.
Walks are seldom physically demanding for young dogs, but they can be
very satisfying. My friend Janis was just today in fact marveling about
a client consult she did where the dog---notably a terrier---didn't bark
at the doorbell when she arrived (!) and was a happy and calm little
thing (the clients were looking to improve his already quite stellar
manners and behavioral health---trainers line up around the block for

[Training is also an under-rated "crossword puzzle for dogs." Even if
you can't train your way out of a paper bag, provided you're not using
pain, intimidation, or "corrections," your dog will likely enjoy the
quality together time and, importantly, get mentally tired trying to
figure out what the heck he's supposed to do to be rewarded. The process
is the product here, which is why there's no need to agonize about how
good you are at it. Get a copy of Don't Shoot the Dog by Karen Pryor,

empathy in people who acquire a second dog in spite of the fact that the
first one's life is made much worse, not least by the stress of having
another dog around when she doesn't actually much like other dogs. Also,
consider the double factor: double the food and gear, double the medical
expenses, double the hair on everything, double the muddy feet, and so
on. In the case of a cat, think very hard and possibly audition one to
make sure your dog views this thing as a friend rather than prey item.

[Getting back to Buttercup the feral Chow, long story short, she ended
up choosing her adopter by engaging with literally irresistible charm,
John Buginas, who teaches with me at The Academy. John already had three
dogs and was technically at maximum capacity. But she would have no
other and we have since, with tongue in cheek, dubbed him The Chow
Whisperer. The dog, now called Dax, seemingly unaware that she basically
won the lottery, has blossomed into a virtual Chow Bombshell whose
spectacular looks literally stop traffic. At the office we sometimes
call her "Marilyn Monroe." John's wife has referred to Dax as a "walking
piece of art." John has no regrets. It's as close as I've ever seen to a
dog worshipping someone. Hearts fly out of her head when she sees

[My latest (honorary Chow) flip is Gladys the Pekingese who flunked her
body handling test on intake. Now the ramifications of an eight pound
snorting thing that looks like it came from another planet trying to
bite people are not up there with a fifty pound Chow being unkeen on
humans, so right off the bat I figured I could phone this one in. And,
as if to lull me further, Gladys sailed through the behavior
modification process in a little over a quarter of the time a case like
hers would normally take. Within a week she was handleable, groomable,
eye-wipeable, ear-cleanable, foot-trimmable, tooth-scaleable, and so on.
The home search began as did the inevitable impulse purchases of Little
Beds, Little Glamour Collars and, notably, a stylish pink sweater. Fast
forward to the other day. It is slightly chilly and damp. Gladys is in
her sweater for the first time. She is fantastically cute and
marketable. Pink is her color. We're coaching students on training plans
in the Academy and John---that would be John the Chow Whisperer---goes
to pick Gladys up and she growls. Can't be. All dogs (not just Chows)
love John. And I fixed her. So we replicate it a few times. Growl,
growl, growl. Debrief: there are a lot of other dogs milling around
(possible minor factor), she is wearing her sweater for the first time
(likely not a factor at all, but a new thing so must be considered) and,
well, well, I hadn't proofed her newfound love of all things body
handling with men (screaming 500 pound gorilla factor). A breathtakingly
rookie move by yours truly.]{.calibre7}

behavior "problems," urinating on porous surfaces (like carpets),
barking at intruders, and competing over resources are all normal dog
behaviors. Problems arise when a dog's natural behavior or choice of
outlet for it conflicts with our rules. And so the onus is on us to help
our dogs better fit into our worlds.]{.calibre7}

[The key to prevention and treatment of most behavior problems is to
manage your dog's environment in order to buy you time to teach him to
employ "legal" outlets, i.e., ones you find acceptable. Think of it as
cutting a deal with the dog that you can both live with. Twenty or
thirty years ago, this approach would have been unthinkable for most
trainers. The model then was that of a dictatorship, with the
alpha-owner squashing all normal behavior in an effort to establish his
or her dominance. But times change and the thinking of most dog trainers
has changed. Part of the reason we love dogs is their very dogginess!

dog expression of his natural behaviors.]{.calibre7}

[If your dog is actually uncomfortable with strangers ("takes a while to
warm up" to visitors or is "reserved," "shy," or "protective"), the
above watch-dog formula will not be enough. In this case, it is
important to get at the underlying under-socialization. As prevention,
socialize puppies extensively to as wide a variety of people and dogs as
possible. You cannot overdo it. Expose them to plenty of places,

[Dogs are highly social animals. Their genetic programming is to be in a
pack with other individuals 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They can
learn to handle being alone for moderate periods of time but, in most
cases, it doesn't come naturally. It's not surprising then that some
dogs develop separation anxiety, a disorder which, in its severe form,
can consist of panic attacks: urinating, defecating, frantically
scratching and chewing at doorframes, barking, and crying whenever the
dog is left alone.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Separation anxiety is often triggered by either a high contrast
situation---months of the owner home all day followed by sudden eight
hour absences---or some sort of life change---rehoming, a stay at a
boarding kennel, a death of a key family member, or major change in
routine. Not all dogs are susceptible---in fact most breeze through
trigger events without developing a hint of the disorder.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Separation anxiety is both preventable and responds well to treatment.
The treatment approach depends on whether the case is mild or severe.
The first step is recognizing that dogs with separation anxiety are not
misbehaving out of boredom, spite, or for fun. Some dogs with separation
anxiety are fine when left alone in the car or fine when the owner
leaves with slippers on to take out the garbage---they have learned the
difference between "long absence" scenarios and "short absence"
scenarios. Others are anxious in all contexts.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Puppies and newly adopted dogs are at higher risk to develop separation
anxiety if they are smothered with constant attention their first few
days home. It is much better to leave for brief periods frequently so
the dog's early learning about departures is that they are no big deal
and predict easy, tolerable lengths of absence: "whenever she leaves,
she comes back." Soften the blow of your departures by providing
extremely enticing stuffed toys for him to unpack. The first time you
leave him for an extended period, tire him out with hard aerobic
exercise ahead of time.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The "bored hunter" model is helpful here too. Give your dog both
physical exercise and mental work to do. Not only does problem solving
increase confidence and independence, it is mentally fatiguing and so
increases the likelihood that your dog will rest quietly when he is left
alone. Get him more focused on toys. When you play with him, incorporate
toys. Hold chewies for him. Teach him to find a toy that you've hidden
in the room and then celebrate his find with tug of war or fetch. Teach
him his toys by name. Ask him to bring you one when you come home. Don't
greet him until he's brought it. Then have a vigorous game of fetch.
Teach him tricks, learn to "free shape" with a clicker, get him involved
in a sport, and, if he's a playful sort, let him play regularly with
other dogs. The more activities and toys are incorporated into his life,
the less he will depend on human social contact as his sole
stimulation.]{.calibre7}

separation anxiety and needs formal desensitization and/or
medication.]{.calibre7}

 \
:::

::: calibre17
[In such cases, the informal interventions above will usually not help.
What's needed is a formal program of systematic desensitization to
change the dog's deeply ingrained emotional reaction to departure. The
track record of systematic desensitization is excellent for resolving
separation anxiety, however it is a huge amount of work for the dog's
caregiver!]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The key is to observe the dog for the first signs of anxiety during the
owner's usual ritual prior to leaving the house. Most dogs with severe
separation anxiety start becoming anxious before the owner leaves. They
have learned the "picture" associated with imminent departure and begin
panting, pacing, salivating, whining, or hiding. In fact, these symptoms
of pre-departure anxiety are one of the ways separation anxiety can be
distinguished from recreational chewing or behavior problems that result
from dogs simply not understanding the rules or lacking outlets for
their energy.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Once the kickoff point of the pre-departure anxiety is found, treatment
begins by repeatedly commencing the ritual at this point, but not adding
the subsequent steps or leaving, to teach the dog to relax in the
presence of the cues that formerly triggered anxiety. Once the dog is
relaxed, subsequent steps in the ritual leading up to departure and,
finally, real absences are gradually introduced, always contingent on
the dog's continued relaxation. The dog is then, over time, worked back
up to normal length absences. Severe separation anxiety is a flag to get
professional help.]{.calibre7}

the dog extremely high value treats after the sound has commenced. Then,
very gradually, the volume is increased. This approach has a spottier

that marking is doubly motivated and there is no safe time envelope when
the dog is "empty." Markers usually keep a reserve in their bladders.
But the formula still works. Just be sure that management is very tight

as soon as you see what amounts to standard housetraining measures, you
feel a welling up inside yourself of "No, no, no, idiot, he's perfectly

[Okay, on to Maynard. Yes, it is quite likely that his urination is
motivated by something to do with the visiting dogs---the uncanny onset
post-party at his age and after two years of perfection is the tip-off.
But, although the motivation for urine marking is not identical to that
in straight housetraining i.e., emptying of bladder vs. some olfactory
or social trigger---the behavior is the same: the dog is depositing
urine in undesired locations. The dog in question has the requisite
spinal cord and so can be conditioned to deposit urine only in desired
locations, outdoors.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[Barking is considered a neotenous trait, which means it's an infantile
or juvenile behavior that has been retained into adulthood. Dogs are
directly descended from wolves and juvenile wolves bark whereas adult
wolves seldom do. Dogs, by contrast, bark a great deal. Whether this was
deliberately selected for during domestication or came along for the
ride when other physical or behavioral traits were selected for is not
known. There also seems to be significant differences among breeds and
individuals with respect to how readily they bark, i.e., their bark
threshold. Some are extremely phlegmatic, requiring a veritable marching
band to prompt them to raise their head from a nap, whereas others, such
as Taz, are hair-trigger, erupting into frenzy at the first hint of
footfall from the mailman two doors down.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[When it comes to modifying barking, it's useful to think about the
antecedents and consequences of barking episodes. Antecedents are
influential events that come before the behavior being analyzed. And
consequences are events that immediately follow behavior. In the case of
watchdog or territorial style barking, like you, I'm not sure I concur
with the popular interpretation that it is driven by the consequence of
seeming to make the mailman withdraw. Given the high proportion of
watchdog barkers that bark regardless of whether the intruder withdraws,
hangs out at the doorway, or enters, I'd venture that the behavior is
primarily antecedent driven. If this is the case, then from a functional
perspective, a more likely interpretation of watchdog barking is that it
sounds an alarm or announces the presence of an intruder. I've often
thought there is a dual purpose here, that of delivering an "intruder
alert" to the owner as well as indicating to the intruder that he has
been detected. It's not a stretch to see the usefulness of this trait,
both during the time of domestication and today.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[An antecedent control interpretation implies that the behavior is
self-reinforcing---its very completion is its own reward. This is why
the alterations in consequence---visitor departing, visitor staying,
etc.---do not make much difference. The behavior has served its function
if it has been triggered by the right antecedent. So, to modify it, it
must either be brought under operant control---meaning insertion of the
behavior into a consequence-driven sequence---or the antecedent must be
addressed. Let's look at each of these strategies in turn.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[To bring an antecedent driven, self-reinforcing activity under operant
control, the behavior needs to be elicited and paid handsomely---at a
level that will trump the intrinsic reinforcer---until the dog comes to
expect payment for delivering the behavior. Jacinthe Bourchard, head
trainer at Pare Safari Africain, a wild animal park near Montreal,
Canada, makes the fabulous analogy about professional hockey players
who, when they were kids, played strictly for the intrinsic
reinforcement---the "joy" of the game. Players who then make it big in
the professional leagues draw significant salaries and the behavior in
many cases comes under this operant control---if the money then becomes
insufficient, they demand more or even go on strike. Many other
professionals report similar "corruption" of the original inherent
pleasure they found in activities once they start earning money,
acclaim, or other potent reinforcers for engaging in the activity.
Amazingly, Bouchard has even witnessed this effect on strongly driven
behaviors such as fixed action patterns in wild animals.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[I have had success bringing barking under operant control by developing
tight stimulus control over both barking and cessation of barking, by
teaching bark-stop-bark-stop as a trick and then migrating back to the
original watchdog context. But the above-described "professional"
barking technique takes less legwork: rather than having to develop
stimulus control first out of context, the trainer can train in vivo,
simply delivering smorgasbords of food to the dog for barking when the
doorbell rings. Eventually, these are withdrawn and the dog, in theory,
goes on strike.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[A classical counter-conditioning procedure could produce similar
results. What appears to be behavior contingent smorgasbord is read as
stimulus contingent smorgasbord to the dog and a competing anticipatory
response to high end food is generated that then confounds the barking.
From the trainer's perspective, it's a moot point---the easiest protocol
to follow is to lavish heavy, heavy pay-offs on the dog when he goes off
in watchdog mode.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Another way to chip at watchdog barking is to turn the antecedent of a
visitor, delivery person, or doorbell ring into a cue for the dog to
engage in another behavior, one that is mutually exclusive to barking.
For instance, a lot of watchdog barkers are terriers or herding dogs,
who are, conveniently, often fetch maniacs. Before initiating any ball,
toy fetch, or Frisbee™ games with these kids, ring the doorbell. Do not
produce the toy and then ring the doorbell as that will result in the
dog readily discriminating between intruder doorbells and fetch
doorbells. Also, try to ring the doorbell without the dog seeing that
it's you doing it. Arrange so that most doorbell rings result in the dog
having to go to the back door, sit, and then go outside to play Frisbee
or fetch. A minority of rings will inevitably result in you answering
the door and there being a bona-fide visitor or delivery person, but
even these can be followed up with a token game of fetch. As soon as the
doorbell rings, prompt the dog, as usual, to wait at the backdoor post,
let him out, answer the door, and then play briefly with the dog. This
technique takes time to kick in, but is well worth it for industrial
strength barkers.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[If Taz is not much of a fetch addict, teach him to target and lie down
in a specific spot. When he's proficient, add the doorbell---without a
visitor---as a cue for the behavior. Then you can start using it in real
situations. Most dogs can't bark as well in a down position, one of the
mysteries of the universe. If Taz breaks his stay, cue and implement a
time out, such as a minute or two in the purgatory of bathroom or
laundry room. For busy-body dogs this is an effective and non-violent
punishment that, combined with the alternative behavior training, can
yield a nice result.]{.calibre7}

[Ah, love. I'll tip my hand early and tell you the greatest likelihood
is that mounting is a sexual behavior. In fact I think this one could
stand some screaming from the rooftops: mounting is sex, mounting is
sex, mounting is sex! That this is not obvious to any onlooker is
actually pretty amazing.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Let's begin at the beginning. Fixed action patterns, or FAP's, are very
important behaviors that are pre-installed in animals, kind of like
bundled software that comes with your computer. They require no learning
and are triggered by something in the environment. A classic example is
a moving bit of string triggering a six week-old kitten to pounce. The
pouncing sequence of movements is stereotyped across all cats. Another
example is how a cat will turn sideways, arch his back, puff up and
hiss. This is a self-defense FAP, again common to all cats and
stereotyped.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Ethologists have coined the "Four F's" to refer to the four big
categories of endeavor under which most FAP's fall. They are Fight,
Flight, Feeding, and Reproduction. Animals that lack competency in their
Four F's don't pass on their incompetent genes. One of the most
interesting things about domestication is that occasional Four F
incompetence might creep in---domesticated animals are no longer making
a living in the world the same way as their wild forbearers so they can
withstand dilution, drifting, or altogether dropping certain software
programs without penalty. A cow without a well developed flight response
is in much less danger than a deer. In some cases, breeding practices
have deliberately magnified portions (think herding, pointing, and
terrier stuff), softened them up, or greatly raised the triggering
threshold for a FAP, such as in the case of Cavalier King Charles
Spaniels who, for the most part, eschew fighting.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Cats are an interesting case as they retain most, if not all, their
Four F FAP's. Because of this, there are many who consider them a
semi-domesticated or even a non-domesticated species. Dogs, however, are
all over the map, breed and individual-wise, with regard to Four F FAP
retention. A given dog may or may not be very predatory (feeding),
skittish and neo-phobic (flight), or highly competitive over resources
(fight).]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[On to sex. At last. Reproductive behavior is, evolutionarily speaking,
the biggest and most important of the four F's. Any animal that lacks
super-duper strong courtship and reproductive FAP's doesn't pass on
their ascetic genes. Genes are rather keen to get themselves passed on
and so never neglect to install the "pass me on now" urge, action, and
wow-was-that-ever-rewarding software in the animals they build. For the
most part domestic animals retain reproduction FAP's, although
technology like artificial insemination reduces the selection pressure
even here.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Sexual behavior in animals has been studied a great deal. Female
mounting is not at all unusual, especially during courtship. In one rat
study I read, female mounting of what a girl rat considers a sluggish
male was referred to as a "super-solicitational" behavior. Perhaps the
rat equivalent of fishnets and a push-up bra.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[In dogs, the courtship and reproduction sequence was studied in
considerable detail by Frank Beach and Ian Dunbar (yes, the Dr. Dunbar)
at the University of California at
Berkeley.[^2^](#Oh_Behave_Do-mack_to_Pinker_split_141.html#filepos603799){#Oh_Behave_Do-mack_to_Pinker_split_064.html#filepos276098
.calibre8} A female who's ready to go might flirt with a male by
mounting, clasping, and thrusting for a bit, then get off, run away and
stop, hopefully with a super-solicited male in hot pursuit, not to
mention oriented at the operative end of the female.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[I don't mean to suggest that your dog is, uh, "loose," primarily
because in play all manner of Four F FAP's are expressed in a giant
jumble. In fact, the leading interpretation of why animals play in the
first place is that they are rehearsing---perhaps de-bugging to stretch
the software metaphor---key FAP's. Dog play consists primarily of
chasing (feeding by the chaser, flight by the chasee), play-biting
(fight and feeding) and wrestling, body-slamming, and pinning (fight),
courtship, and copulatory behaviors such as pawing, mounting, clasping,
and thrusting. These are punctuated by "meta-signals" such as play-bows,
bouncy movements, and grinning play faces, which signal the playful
intent of the F's they precede and follow. And note, all sexes might
mount and be mounted by all other sexes: it's play. The chasee in a
chase game isn't a real wildebeest either.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[So, when you say she's "playing well," I presume you mean she's biting,
chasing, slamming, and wrestling with other dogs. I am wholly fascinated
by the sheer number of dog owners out there---you are in good
company---that find these behaviors non-obnoxious, but consider sex play
across the line or, amazingly, not about sex at all! Attend any dog park
and you'll see owners continually and automatically defaulting to a
non-sexual explanation for mounting, notably our old favorite,
dominance. Now I'm no shrink, but unless dogs are way more into S&M than
anybody has reckoned, when an animal mounts and thrusts, I think we need
to rule out sex before entertaining other interpretations. In other
words, when an animal does the grand-daddy of all FAP's during play,
which is about FAP rehearsal, mightn't it be play sex, just like the
play fighting, play predation, and play fleeing? Bottom line: Your kid
is also playing well when she mounts! In dog play generally, if a
healthy dose of sex play wasn't present along with the other F's, it'd
be a conspicuous absence requiring some fancy explaining.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[I am not sure whether the abstemious streak in North American culture
whirls us, like a centrifuge, away from the S word when we see
copulatory behaviors during play or whether we're so dominance-obsessed,
we co-opt nookie-nookie into some sort of power play. In any case, if
you would like less of it, provide a non-violent consequence, such as a
time out, whenever she does it. It could be two minutes outside the play
area or, if you want to throw the book at her, march her back to the car
and take her straight home. If, on the other hand, you think you might
consider allowing her to do it during play, perform a consent test. If
you suspect at any time that her partner may not be consenting, pull her
off for a moment. Does the mountee grab this opportunity to get away?
Does he or she hang out nearby? Or does he or she solicit play from your
dog? This same consent test, by the way, works for pinning, wrestling,
chasing, and other behaviors where there is any doubt about whether both
dogs are enjoying the action.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre5

:::

::: calibre17
[The consent of both owners is also important. Although I have poked fun
at some of the Puritanical motives that may be driving our 180 degree
turn away from interpretations of mounting that involve sex, no owner at
a dog park should be bullied by other owners, however well meaning, into
allowing some activity with which they're uncomfortable, including
mounting. If everyone passes the consent test, the dogs can
proceed.]{.calibre7}

[Car whining is among the most difficult behaviors to eradicate. The
reason is that the type of car whining you describe is not driven by
reinforcers or punishers, or by visual stimuli outside the car, which is
why the standard measures you've used bounce off it. Nikita and Klaus
were wide awake and taking copious notes in Intro Psych when Pavlovian
conditioning was discussed.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[A lot of dog behavior that is of interest to us is most readily
modifiable by operant conditioning, the timely application of good and
nasty consequences to increase and decrease its frequency. If a dog
wants to go out in the yard, your act of opening the door is a
reinforcing event. If barking makes you open it, barking is the
reinforced behavior. If pawing the door makes it open, pawing is
reinforced. And so on. If barking stops making the door open, it will
eventually extinguish. The vast majority of dog people have some sense
of this way of training.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[Not all behavior, however, is most easily explained and understood in
terms of its consequences. Some is best explained by the rules governing
Pavlovian (or "Classical"), conditioning. For instance, take a sandwich
instead of a door to the yard. If a dog barks and you give him some
sandwich, barking goes up. So far so good. And, if you give him a
sandwich when he stops barking, barking will go down. But, if the
behavior is salivating instead of barking, you have a problem. No matter
how expertly you communicate that the less he salivates, the better his
chances of some sandwich, and the more he salivates the worse his
chances get, salivation goes up. He ruins his own chances every time.
This is because the anticipation of a piece of sandwich---involuntary
salivation---trumps the operant refrain-from-salivating-for-sandwich
contingency.]{.calibre7}

Leashes coming out of the closet tip them off that walkies are next, a

of the garage door opener tips them off that mom is home. This ability
to anticipate and thus prepare oneself for imminent events, gave animals
that were able to do so an edge over animals that could not, and so
classical conditioning evolved. The form the self-preparation takes
varies, depending on what the animal is preparing himself for.
Salivation and gastric secretions are good preparation for food, and

who are about to fight or flee. Note that these anticipatory responses

turn onto the street that leads to the parking lot and so on.
Eventually, the dog might start quivering with delight as soon as you
load him up. If there is also a sufficiency of dull, boring car rides,

[Clothing or gear can then come into play as discrimination aids. The
best tip-off to whether any given ride is going to be to something
great, middling, or hideous, however, might be the route. Leaving the
driveway and early streets on the route are ambiguous, but a particular
turn might be the tip-off that the park is the destination. In these
cases, the dog's whining commences after the particular turn that spells
park as destination. Failure to take that turn results in settling down
or getting worried, depending on whether the dog has learned
errands-only and bad news tip-offs. If a susceptible dog has too large a
proportion of car rides to the fun place, car-whining can bleed
backwards to the entire route.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre5

:::

::: calibre17
[One solution is to condition a confinement of the whining to the later
parts of the trip by initiating more dull-o car rides that employ most
of the route to the dog park, but then veer off at a critical juncture
to endless boring errands. The dog will then learn that fork and
gradually whine less prior to the dog-park-predicting turn. The whining
gets compartmentalized.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre5

:::

::: calibre17
[Undoing whining in your dogs is a heftier challenge. They likely have
multiple routes leading to all these varied fantastic things so have a
general car ride CER. A regime of much more frequent super-boring car
rides might help. If you can work out a way to compartmentalize the fun
by developing a cue that means "good stuff is coming\...," you might be
able to kill or reduce it at other times. For instance, take a bunch of
trips toward the fetch park, aborting at a certain point. At some
point---hopefully sooner rather than later for your sake---the CER will
start to extinguish. Once it's dialed down, alternate trips to the park
with trips almost to the park that terminate in boring nothingness. On
the real park trips, give a cue near the final turn: "wanna go to the
PARK???" And then proceed to the fun fun fun. On the non-park trips, say
nothing. The cue becomes a more reliable predictor than the car-ride. If
it works, try a similar procedure for your other exciting destinations.
By doing this you're exploiting the same laws of classical conditioning
that got you into this boat in the first place.]{.calibre7}

[The cognitive decline in older dogs has been dubbed "doggie
Alzheimer's" and with good reason. In human Alzheimer's, the presence
and quantity of beta amyloid plaques in the brains and blood vessels of
victims are associated with the degree of decline in brain function.
When geriatric dogs are so tested, a similar association is found. It is
not known yet whether dogs suffer from reductions in key
neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine as has been found
in human Alzheimer's patients. There is some suggestion that this may be
based on the response of symptomatic dogs to a medication that inhibits
the action of enzymes that metabolize dopamine.]{.calibre7}

[The medication, selegiline HCI (Anipryl), was one of the early MAOI
anti-depressant medications that has since been topped by newer
generations of tri-cyclics and SSRI's for human depression and obsessive
compulsive disorders. It has gained a second life, however, for
treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's in humans, which made it a
logical choice to be tested for use in elderly dogs with Alzheimer-like
symptoms. It fared relatively well and is now approved for use in dogs
in both Canada and the U.S. Most veterinarians are acquainted with this
medication and the diagnostic screening procedure put forward by its
manufacturer. Dogs have been on Anipryl long-term without adverse
effects. There are other drugs in the pipeline for human memory loss and
Alzheimer's disease, however it may be many years before any of these
trickle down to dogs.]{.calibre7}

[It's not surprising that health care of older dogs is a hot topic among
proponents of alternative and integrative medicine (which combines
mainstream medical practice with nutrition, herbs, etc.). There may be
changes in diet or supplements that would be in the
can't-hurt-might-help category for Fly. For example, it has been
suggested that certain B-vitamins, anti-oxidants, and even the herb
Ginkgo Biloba might help preserve or even improve cognitive function.
Free-radical reduction and scavenging are among the speculated
mechanisms of Anipryl, so it's certainly plausible that anti-oxidants
such as vitamin C, E, mixed carotenoids, alpha lipoic acid, Co-enzyme
Q10, etc. could be beneficial. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in cold-water
fish oils, are recommended to humans who wish to maximize brain
function. Before implementing any herbs or supplements, be sure to run
your plans past your veterinarian as interactions between medicines,
herbs, and supplements are not always benign.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[I am especially intrigued by evidence that exercising one's brain with
new learning, problem-solving, and social interaction is a route to
preserve brain function. This is something that could be also evaluated
in dogs. Very often older dogs are sidelined, due to declines in
performance levels, absence of behavior problems to motivate the owner
to provide exercise and stimulation (i.e., they are more forgiving than
younger dogs), and, in the case of multi-dog households, time and energy
devoted to the performance activities of younger housemates. Perhaps
problem-solving and learning activities---teaching old dogs new
tricks---could be part of a comprehensive effort to keep their brains
sharp into old age.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[There are two kinds of consequence: reinforcement, which increases
behavior; and punishment, which decreases behavior. Within each category
there are two options, pain (the techie word for this is "aversives")
and pleasure. It's very intuitive that pleasure is reinforcing and pain
is punishing. What's less obvious is how pain enters into reinforcement
and pleasure into punishment. When pain ends, it is (negatively)
reinforcing---think relief from headaches, a warm house on an icy day,
or switching off the blaring alarm you accidentally set off in your car.
Aspirin taking, going inside, and putting the key in the car ignition
are reinforced. When pleasure ends, it is (negatively) punishing---think
Monday morning, removal of money through fines and taxes, or birders
scaring away fantastically rare specimens by sneezing.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The continuum of training methods boils down to which of the above four
types of consequence is used and how often. At one end of the spectrum
are trainers who use primarily pain and startle and at the other
trainers who use primarily rewards, or pleasure. In the middle are those
who use combinations of starting and stopping pain and pleasure.
Trainers who call their methods "pain free" or "without aversives" train
by starting and stopping pleasurable things, which means they employ
positive reinforcement and negative punishment. This is sometimes
mislabeled as "operant," "no punishment," or "all positives." All
consequences, including the most egregiously painful, are operant
conditioning; negative punishment is, by definition, aversive-free and
positive punishment is the kind of punishment where pain is
involved.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Although the great wall dividing these approaches is whether pain is
used or not, another interesting and more porous wall is that between
trainers who use exclusively positive reinforcement (pleasure starting)
and those who also use negative punishment (pleasure removal). There
have recently been some claims floating around that time outs cause
stress and side-effects comparable to those associated with aversives.
Although I can find no research to support this, if such side effects
actually do occur, there are a couple of possible mechanisms. One is
separation anxiety. Negative punishment includes the removal of any
reinforcing event or opportunity---food, a favorite game, or social
access. When this last one is used in a dog that finds being alone not
simply less reinforcing than being with someone, but actually
distressing, the consequence bleeds over into positive
punishment---i.e., aversives---territory.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The other possible explanation is frustration. When animals (including
humans of course) experience abrupt cessation of things they like, they
feel frustrated. The question is whether the frustration constitutes the
same distress sensations that elicit fight or flight mechanisms. This
seems implausible unless one considers cases where the reinforcer
cessation is used with an animal already under chronic stress or where
the criteria for gaining urgently needed reinforcers is deceptively
unwinnable. Think Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down, where every
conceivable frustrating event of everyday life is thrown at his
character in grim succession. In more mundane negative punishment
scenarios, mild frustration can make the behavior appear worse
temporarily. Puppies timed out for biting hard may briefly channel their
frustration at being left alone into worse biting when the owner
returns. Sometimes the opposite happens---the time out is a quiet time,
and the dog seems more relaxed when the owner returns. Whether one
particular time out elicits frustration or settles the dog down,
however, its important thrust is as a consequence of previous
behavior.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Time out is one of those techniques with an incredibly good track
record for behaviors such as puppy biting or rude greeting, because
owner contact is what the dog most wants at the time of the punishment.
The catch is achieving all the elements of good execution. These

:::

::: calibre17
[The dog will quickly learn what drives people away if the standard is
unwavering. This means the owner must deliver time outs based on a
certain degree of bite pressure, rather than based on how fed up the
owner is or the owner's whim about what to tolerate today. A dog living
with more than one person necessitates some estimating of what
constitutes a hard enough bite for a time out. A warning cue makes the
moving target of multiple standards much more navigable for the dog.
This is a signal that means "you're on thin ice---the next bite like
that one, or worse, and you'll be playing by yourself."]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The punishment, once earned by a too-hard bite, must be delivered
without delay. Otherwise, another behavior that occurs in the interim
will be inadvertently punished. This is part of the rationale behind the
owner yelping before giving time outs to puppies. The yelp marks the
exact moment of transgression. Clicker aficionados will recognize this
concept. The yelp (or other signal, such as "too bad for you") bridges
between the crunch and the time out, a consequence that is difficult to
deliver with razor sharp timing.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The delivery of the time out is ideally accomplished by leaving the
puppy, rather than making the puppy leave you. The latter version is the
one used to time out dogs for naughty behavior at the dog park or puppy
class. There is potential fallout from collecting a dog to deliver a
time out---any attendant leash or man-handling executed by angry or
exasperated owners can take on an aversive edge, which invites side
effects such as wariness of hands or approach in the dog. Luckily, with
puppy biting, the owner can visit and exit the confinement area. This is
the cleanest execution.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Which brings us to legwork. The owner must get up and step over the
gate/leave the room, wait a minute or so and then return, and likely
will have to do it again in short order. And again. And again. This is
expensive behavior for people, especially given the absence of instant
gratification---it doesn't work instantly. But to keep the standard
clear and consistent, the owner must deliver the consequence every time.
Non-compliance due to "legwork laziness" is a pet peeve of dog trainers.
It only works if you do it.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Finally, the punishment---tautologically---must be punishing. For
example, in the early education of humans there are two kinds of time
outs, inclusionary and exclusionary. They are, respectively, time outs
where the child remains in the social group, but is ignored and time
outs where the child is removed from access to the social group. You'll
occasionally see inclusionary time outs recommended for dogs: "cross
your arms and ignore him" or "turn your back on him." In the case of a
jumping-up dog who is most motivated by the owner's reaction, an
inclusionary time out such as this could be punishing. In the case of a
jumper who is reinforced by increased facial proximity, it very well
might not be. A good rule of thumb for dogs is: if an inclusionary time
out isn't working, try exclusionary. In fact, I usually recommend
exclusionary time outs first for play biting or behavior that is
elicited by a greeting context, i.e., the dog finds your presence the
most motivating thing at that moment.]{.calibre7}

[Serious agility people are drawn to high rewing dogs such as the
herding breeds on your short list. Herding dogs, like members of most
groups, are not a perfectly homogenous lot, but there are notable
behavior features common among them. One is "high drive," the thing that
makes them excel at sports. High drive to dog trainers means a
combination of ease-of-motivation---they are "driven" by moving objects
and a compulsive desire to fetch and to tug, easily motivated with food
or force---and perseverance or "work ethic." They focus well and will
work longer and harder than many other breeds. This is one of the things
that get them into trouble in pet homes.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5

:::

::: calibre17
[Another tendency that can prove beyond the means of pet owners is their
hair trigger sensitivity. The dogs you mention, and herding dogs
generally, are spookier than the average dog. This might manifest as
shyness with strangers, caution in new situations, sound sensitivity, or
some combination of these. It could be that sensitivity is a good trait
in a working herding dog. They have to be controllable in a
quasi-predatory situation at great distances from their handler. It may
also be, along with the drive, part of what makes them easy to train in
contexts other than herding. The down side is a tendency toward
neophobia---fear of novelty---and more ready acquisition of fears and
anxieties along with occasional refractoriness to treatment once these
are acquired.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[In case I haven't already alienated readers with this somewhat
bull-in-the-china-shop stereotyping, I'll now go further out on the
opinion limb and say that herding dogs have a bigger than average talent
for resource guarding, especially from other dogs. I think this goes
part and parcel with the drive. Herding dogs value stuff. And some can
be less tolerant than the average retriever about other dogs being
around their stuff, or being around at all, especially when they're
Busy. Which they very often are.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5

::: calibre17
[These qualities---high drive, high fearfulness, and high resource
guarding---sometimes don't emerge until the dog hits social maturity at
some time between ages one and three years. If this is a real phenomenon
rather than just my idle musings, it means a fearless, non-guarding, and
moderately drivey sheepdog at age ten months might morph into something
more skittish, more possessive, and less tolerant of dogs by age three,
without any particular errors or omissions in rearing. This is not to
say that well-conceived and well-executed behavior modification can't
attenuate or help prevent it. In fact, if I had to raise a herding dog
tomorrow, I'd be super diligent in these areas with a view to
prevention, and super-duper diligent in these areas if a problem were to
arise in spite of my prevention campaign.]{.calibre7}

"Dumpling TV" and Dumpling will start to believe she is not going to

Clyde spends less and less time at the gate when Dumpling is in view
and/or it is easy to break his focus when he is watching Dumpling.
Dumpling will be hiding less and less as her curiosity gets the better
of her and it becomes apparent Clyde can't get at her. When Clyde is out
on walkies, she can hop over the gate and check out Clyde's stuff,
hopping back to her sanctuary when he returns.]{.calibre7}

Bring Clyde into Dumpling's space on leash with a bag of treats for both
animals. Focus mostly on Clyde. The rule for him is: he does as he's
told (i.e., down-stays for treats) or he has to go back behind the gate.
If he was particularly eager to get at Dumpling in the earlier days, he
may rev up again now. Stick to your guns. Go into Dumpling land and ask
Clyde to down-stay (if you've never practiced this, spend a couple of
sessions doing so before practicing around the cat). If he does, praise
him and give him treats. If he breaks his stay, he is banished to his
own territory. If you don't cave, he will learn quickly that it is very
much to his advantage to hold his stay.]{.calibre7}

attend to Clyde and sprinkle treats out for Dumpling. Use good treats,
something she doesn't normally get. Clyde close by means
treats.]{.calibre7}

[If this goes badly, do the same thing, but with the animals on their
respective sides of the gate. If it goes well, repeat it a few more
times until Dumpling likes the exercise. She'll vote with her feet, so
there'll be no doubt. The next step is to allow Clyde some movement
still on leash. He no longer has to be in a down-stay, but he still
mustn't come on strong to Dumpling. Praise and treat him for nice
manners. If this goes well and Dumpling elects to hang around, you can
remove the leash and, if that goes well, dispense with the gate. You may
decide to continue to have one room where Dumpling can get away from
Clyde. Many cat and dog owners maintain such a dog-free "safe room" for
the cat even when there are apparently good relations.]{.calibre7}

[The only thing resembling research on the questions you ask is an
opinion poll conducted by Benjamin and Lynette Hart some years ago on
breeds and behavior. The Harts asked veterinarians, trainers, and
groomers whether they thought certain breeds barked more, were more
aggressive in certain situations, harder to housetrain, etc. Because
it's an opinion poll (with all the baggage that comes with that
approach) rather than objective research, it's difficult to gauge the
accuracy. The good news is that the explosion of interest in dog
genomics will likely lead to fabulous answers---and more sophisticated
questions---in the coming years.]{.calibre7}

[I'd venture that there is some consensus among my own group, dog
trainers, that there are issues that crop up more often in small dogs.
They are not dissimilar to some that you list: notably fearfulness,
barking, and housetraining. Let's look at each of these for plausibility
or evidence, and possible causes.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[By nervousness you are probably referring to anxiety or fearfulness in
social situations with strangers and/or other dogs. This could manifest
as aggressive displays ("go away!") or avoidance ("okay, I'll go
away!"). If small dogs do suffer from more than their share of social
anxiety, the two obvious candidate explanations are genetics and
socialization. The genetics question is best posed as: Does exerting
selective breeding pressure to miniaturize an animal bring any
fearfulness along for the ride? There are absolutely genetic mechanisms
that could do such a thing so it's possible, but it's also far from
proven. Socialization may be a more plausible explanation. Do small dogs
get less socialization, on average, than larger dogs? The stakes are
smaller---pardon the pun---If socialization is inadequate in a small dog
and so perhaps there is a reduced incentive effect. There may also be
some very understandable reticence on the part of small dog owners to
expose their more physically fragile puppies to larger puppies and
dogs.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[There is a pervasive feeling that smaller dogs bark more but, again,
this has never been looked at in a rigorous, scientific way. It would be
easy to do: get a decent number of dogs representing size categories and
count barks in the usual barking contexts. But it hasn't been done, so
we're left to speculate again on possible causes for an effect that may
not even exist. Genetics would be a possible explanation as would be the
dog's day to day environment, primarily the owner variable. How does the
owner respond to barking?]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[In the case of housetraining, I would be willing to bet that there is
an incentive effect going on. Great Danes who still urinate in the house
at age six months create massive, Def Con III incentives to buckle down
and get the dog pottying outside, whereas Yorkies might elicit only
sighing or eye-rolling. A lot of trainers feel that there's also a
small-bladder/frequent-urination factor along with a more subtle squat
that can make the little guys more challenging. Some trainers go so far
as to indict certain breeds as being inherently, i.e., genetically, more
difficult to housetrain. And, finally, owners of smaller dogs may be
more ambivalent about whether to paper or housetrain the dog, and this
can make for a moving target objective-wise, which might bog down
training efforts.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[There's an issue you didn't mention that I'm going to risk broaching,
and that's owner or lap guarding. Some very otherwise charming little
dogs can become ferocious looking when approached while in owner arms or
on laps. This might be simply due to the fact that they can be in their
owners' arms or on their laps, i.e., more medium and large dogs would do
it too if they were ever attached to their owners in this fashion. Or it
could be the incentive factor is lacking for both breeders to breed it
out or owners to train it out. It's even possible some owners find it a
bit flattering and so unconsciously reinforce it. For anyone with such a
dog, the usual anti-resource guarding protocols work nicely as does the
management technique of detaching the dog from oneself in potentially
provocative contexts.]{.calibre7}

[People will live with all manner of stuff, but almost nobody will live
with chronic house-soiling. Almost. I once did get a call for a young
couple whose twenty-odd pound dog performed both functions several times
a day on the wall to wall carpet all over their house. For four years.
They shampooed the carpet every day. When I arrived, the tiny house,
orderly and otherwise normal, reeked vaguely of feces and strongly of
cleaning product. The dog was well groomed, fiercely loved, and they
were mortified at the state of their home. They also seemed rusty at
welcoming guests. By sheer luck, they had found out the week before the
consult that something could be done. The Fed-Ex guy had gotten a whiff
and said his own dog had been "fixed." I wonder if that moment for them
was like suddenly remembering you had five hundred thousand dollars
stuffed in your mattress. Kind of a combination of "this is too good to
be true" and "you mean I've been clipping coupons for four
years?"]{.calibre7}

[A pretty common theme that crops up in housetraining is nomenclature.
Labeling disagreements need to be put to bed before any actual
counseling can take place. Take marking. "It's lovely to meet you and
Thor. How can I be of assistance?" "He's perfectly housetrained, but he
marks the furniture." Mirroring time. "So what I'm hearing is Thor
urinates inside and you'd like him to do that only outside." "No no no,
he's housetrained; he's MARKING." "By marking, do you mean he's peeing?"
"Well of course." Most clients have the grace to not say "duh" at this
point. "Okay, so the plan will be to get him to pee exclusively
outside." Heavy sigh. "He already pees outside, we need him to stop
MARKING." And so on. After a few of these, it occurred to me that I
could leap-frog this agony altogether by leading with "Ahhhh, MARKING!
Here's how we tame that baby." And then proceed to describe standard
remedial housetraining. They do beautifully and everybody's
happy.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Another obstacle to getting buy-in for the air-tight management and
training regimes necessary to resolve most housetraining cases is the
perfection of prior dogs. The vast majority of dogs kind of sort of
housetrain themselves in spite of slightly half-assed efforts by their
owners. Dog trainers are never presented with these housetraining
self-taughts. They are our invisible enemy. They are Lassie. And the
mists of time improve them. A string of such dogs in the case of a
particular owner sets up some mountainous expectations, which then
collide with any less easy to train dog that comes along subsequently.
Most of these kids are not lemons, but they do require a by-the-book
housetraining procedure. To an owner who has never had to do the
by-the-book procedure, which requires a few weeks of genuine effort, it
must feel like sounding out single syllable words for attorneys. "I have
to do what? My last dog\..."]{.calibre7}

[The worst ever in the Dog Immediately Following Perfect Dog department
was Mr. and Mrs. Burt, whose slightly PTSD-looking Cocker Spaniel,
Glory, lay at their feet. To ensure razor-sharp timing, Mr. Burt had
done a stake-out in the kitchen during Glory's first weekend home.
Whenever Glory would squat to eliminate, Mr. Burt would thunder
"NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!" and whisk him out to the yard by the scruff of the
neck. Glory, rather wisely, ceased eliminating around the Burts. He
would wait, stalk-still, in the yard, Mr. or Mrs. Burt on stand-by. From
Glory's perspective they must have seemed like Dirty Harry looming over
him, cocked and ready: "Go ahead---make my day\..." He never found out
it would have been scritchies and a cookie had he dared try on the
grass. Then, as soon as he was alone, which only happened in the house,
he finally relieved himself. In safety. Dog trainers affectionately call

back-story included bark-deterring bad guys attempting to break and
enter. If they had laid out a pinned-under-tractor fantasy scenario I
couldn't have been more discouraged. I tried the sympathy card. "Wow.
That's sure a tough act to follow." Their eyes got all glittery. "Well,

[If you are asking whether I think that behavior is without cause, then
I would say no, I don't believe that behavior just "is." There are
always determinants, even when we don't know what they are. If, on the
other hand, what you mean is, "Are most or all shy dogs formerly
abused?" then I think you are really onto something. I have observed, as
you have, the tendency of people to invoke abuse as an explanation for
shy or fearful behavior in dogs. It could be that people find it
reinforcing to have taken on a hard-luck case. One need only scan the
pop TV fare, replete with tragedy and against-the-odds comebacks, to
know that humans are drawn to stories of the overcoming (or not) of
egregious adversity.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Some of these dogs may have had abuse histories, but in reality,
outright abuse is far from necessary to produce fearful behavior. Fear
is incredibly easy to come by. The reason is that, in nature, when it
comes to self-defense---the reason there is fear in the first
place---the cost of a false positive far outweighs the cost of a false
negative. What this means is that animals who err on the side of being
too skittish out-survive and out-reproduce animals who err on the side
of being too relaxed.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[For example, let's imagine that you and I are two animals making a
living in the world. You are the more skittish animal and I am the more
relaxed. There will be times when an innocuous stimulus---something
harmless---spooks you. There is a cost to these false positives. You
wasted energy. You made yourself conspicuous while spooking. You might
have hurt your leg running away. It might have been a food source you
ran from. And so on. Now let's look at me, Ms. mellow animal, and what
happens when I get it wrong, a false negative. There will be times when
a truly dangerous stimulus fails to spook me. I'm toast as are all my
theoretical descendents bearing my laid back genes. Ultimate cost. And
so there is huge selective pressure on the evolution of fear. As it
happens, there are different possible pathways for fear to use to get
its job done.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[What are the pathways? There are five. The first is genetics. There is
ample evidence---in rodents, dogs, and humans, among others---that a
predisposition to be fearful can be inherited. A well known experiment
was performed on dogs by Murphree in the
1970s.[^4^](#Oh_Behave_Do-mack_to_Pinker_split_141.html#filepos604459){#Oh_Behave_Do-mack_to_Pinker_split_074.html#filepos339410
.calibre8} Commencing with normal Pointers, he bred the most fearful to
the most fearful each generation, along with a normal control strain.
After only a few generations, marked and seemingly refractory fear
appeared in spite of normal rearing. It's important to note here that
there is not one "fear gene," but rather a variety of genes that affect
the endocrine system's physiology including neurotransmitter production,
receptors, and re-uptake. Murphree clearly tapped into one or more of
these. The second way to get a fearful animal is via its prenatal
environment, i.e., stress during pregnancy. In rodents it has been shown
that stressing the pregnant female results in adult offspring with
decreased stress resilience. The mechanism is the impairment of an
important negative feedback mechanism in the offspring's
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This results in the adult
animal having difficulty "coming down" once spooked.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The third fear avenue is maternal behavior. An experiment was done on
dogs wherein two bitches, one genetically fearful and one genetically
normal, were bred and then their litters swapped at birth. Predictably,
the genetically fearful puppies reared by the normal dam were fearful
but, interestingly, the genetically normal puppies reared by the
genetically fearful dam were also more fearful than cross-fostered
controls (ruling out the mom switch per se as a confounding variable).
The mechanism couldn't have been genetics. So, was it the dam's milk?
Some sort of social learning? Is it simply stressful being around a
fearful mom? No one yet knows for sure.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Next in the fear production parade is classical conditioning. Dogs are
not born fearing veterinary waiting rooms or the sight of nail clippers
coming out of the tack box. They learn which things in their environment
predict other, intrinsically scary things.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Finally, fear can be the result of impoverished early environment. It
has been really well established that if you raise puppies through their
socialization period, i.e., up to age twelve weeks or so, without human
contact, they will be profoundly shy of humans. It has been further
shown that a little intervention---some regular handling during this
period for instance---greatly attenuates the effect. There is even some
suggestion that enriched handling---i.e., mild (operative word mild
here---a little is good, but a lot is definitely not better) daily
stress for neonates---may increase stress resilience as adults. Where
agreement disintegrates, however, is on the question of whether, once a
puppy has been made shy by impoverished early environment, he can be
turned around a little, a lot, or at all by subsequent intervention.
Indeed, there is not much agreement about whether a fearful dog of any
variety can be significantly improved. And, if it can, when and how can
it---what individual case variables matter, what technique(s) work, and
what is the time frame? Answers to such questions would assist prognosis
estimates and treatment efficiency.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[There is impressive agreement that fear is a much tougher nut to crack
than most behavior problems. Even those, such as myself, who advocate
that fear can often be greatly improved, emphasize that it is usually a
much slower haul than installing manners, obedience, or resolving
house-soiling. There is also pretty good agreement that diligent
prevention---careful selection of breeding stock, socialization of young
puppies, etc.---far outpaces treatment of an existing problem as a
better option.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[One of the difficulties with fear is its seemingly spontaneous
worsening, sometimes as a function of social maturity, but other times
due to its irksome property of generalizing, all by itself, to a broader
range of stimuli than the original problem. For example, a dog that is
fearful of large men with hats may erode to be fearful of large men
without hats, then all men, then some women.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[A sure take home message is that under no circumstances should one
breed a fearful bitch, especially a suspected genetically fearful one.
In this latter case, the puppies get blasted three ways. They get it via
their mom's genes, they get it if their easier-to-stress mom is stressed
during her pregnancy, and they get reared by a fearful dam.]{.calibre7}

[It sounds like Muffin has acral lick dermatitis, or ALD. The question
of whether her problem is a physical or mental one is complicated. What
kicks off ALD is often completely different from what ends up
maintaining the problem. A classic case gets up and running when the dog
has some physical condition such as a skin allergy or fungal infection,
ringworm, scabies, demodex, nerve inflammation, arthritis, or even local
tumors. Then, even if the primary physical problem fades or is resolved,
the licking carries on. At this point the problem is considered a
compulsive disorder (it's not known whether dogs have obsessive
thoughts, so it's just called "compulsive disorder" in dogs rather than
obsessive-compulsive disorder).]{.calibre7}

[Compulsive disorders can be the end result of dogs trying to cope with
frustration and conflicting motivation. In the frustration department,
consider the life of many dogs: a fairly steady stream of not being able
to access things they see behind fences and beyond the end of their
leashes. Conflict might look like a dog who is simultaneously curious
and afraid of the same thing. Another example is a dog who is sometimes
greeted and sometimes punished by his owner in similar situations, such
as when the owner arrives home or approaches. The dog feels a
simultaneous urge to greet and avoid, which, if you think about it, can
be crazy-making.]{.calibre7}

[The acute feeling of frustration or conflict might result in a
redirected or displaced behavior. Dog trainers will tell you about
getting redirected bites when grabbing the collar of a dog who is highly
motivated to fight. The trainer is not the real target, but is unloaded
on because she is handy and in the way. Displaced behavior, by contrast,
is seemingly irrelevant to the context in which it occurs. The dog is
conflicted so neither approaches nor avoids, but chases his tail
instead. If the frustration or conflicts are chronic enough, the
behavior becomes more entrenched and at a certain frequency gets dubbed
a compulsive disorder. Once it's at this stage, it'll happen whenever
the dog feels stressed or is bored and, in the most severe cases,
virtually all the time the dog is not otherwise occupied.]{.calibre7}

[Aside from acral lick dermatitis, also known as lick granulomas,
compulsive disorders include (imaginary) fly-catching, flank sucking,
whirling in place and tail-chasing, pacing, chasing shadows or imaginary
objects, staring into space, excessive drinking, and
self-mutilation.]{.calibre7}

[Which particular behavior a given dog ends up with is thought to be at
least partly genetically predisposed. For instance, breed
over-representations include flank sucking in Dobermans, fly-catching in
Miniature Schnauzers, and whirling in Bull Terriers. Lick granulomas pop
up more often in Dobies, German Shepherds, and Danes, such as Muffin.
Another potential determination of a dog's particular "choice" of
compulsive disorder has to do with whether the original kick-off
stressor was a repeated conflict or due primarily to the particular
frustration of extremely low stimulation, i.e., boredom. Dogs who
experience chronic conflict tend toward the high energy disorders such
as tail-chasing or "popping" (jumping up and down in place) and then,
once the disorder is entrenched, proceed to engage in their compulsion
whenever they get amped up. Self-directors---like Muffin---might
commence due to one of the physical causes described earlier, or
conflict, and then carry on at times of low stimulation.]{.calibre7}

[Another thing that can maintain ALD in particular is a vicious cycle of
endorphin addiction. Once the dog has created a significant sore, the
body releases its natural painkillers. If the dog ceases licking, the
endorphins are not produced and the dog literally experiences
withdrawal. So, the dog licks to keep the sore alive in order to produce
the endorphins.]{.calibre7}

[If the ball is passed to the behavior court, you should increase
exercise and mental stimulation. Depending on Muffin's exercise
tolerance---check with the vet on this---commence a daily bout of hard
aerobic exercise. Perhaps more importantly, Muffin needs a Job to do. If
there are courses in your area, enroll in something like a tricks class,
musical freestyle, or advanced obedience. It doesn't matter if Muffin is
a huge talent at the activity: the process is the product. We want
Muffin's mind challenged.]{.calibre7}

[An important caveat: be sure the course is taught using a
punishment-free method. Regardless of what your personal philosophy is
of dog training and regardless of any proposed merits of training dogs
with correction collars, in the case of compulsive disorder resolution,
removing punishments from the dog's life is a cornerstone of treatment.
If there are no courses in your area, get a book on clicker training and
learn to free-shape behavior. Karen Pryor's [Don't Shoot the

[It would also be a good idea to invest in chewies and puzzle
toys---stuffed Kongs™ and activity balls where Muffin must roll them
around in order to extract part of her meal ration. There's even a new

Muffin can get unstuffing projects throughout the day when she's
alone.]{.calibre7}

[You and your husband must bone up on ways to communicate with Muffin in
a consistent manner, specifically to avoid any

[Consult with your veterinarian on a potential course of
anti-obsessional medication. The tri-cyclic anti-depressant clomipramine
(Clomicalm) and some drugs in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
class, such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and fluvoxamine (Luvox), have track
records at working well in conjunction with the behavior modification
measures listed above. In the case of ALD, hydrocodone, the narcotic
agent found in Vicodin, has proved helpful in certain cases. Aside from
providing pain relief, it has been speculated that an exogenous opiate
source interrupts the vicious endorphin cycle. Using similar logic,
opiate antagonists pre-empt the endorphin pay-off and render the
behavior unreinforcing. This therapy is usually considered a last
resort.]{.calibre7}

[Medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), amitriptyline (Elavil), and
clomipramine (Clomicalm), achieve their effects by altering chemical
messengers in the dog's brain. Neurons, the brain's specialized cells,
are not in direct contact with each other. In order for the electrical
signal from one to continue to the next, a chemical signal is
transmitted across the tiny gap, called the synapse, between neurons.
The chemical messengers are molecules called neurotransmitters. These
molecules play a very important role in regulating our moods and
controlling functions such as appetite and sleep, as well as emotions
such as anxiety. Inside the terminal of each neuron are little pouches
called vessicles that store each neuron's supply of
neurotransmitters.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[When an electrical signal travels along the neuron and reaches the
terminal, it signals the vessicle to release some or all of its supply
of a certain neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter swims through the
fluid in the synapse in a fraction of a second and contacts the
neighboring neuron's receptors. There are many types of receptors. Like
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, each kind of receptor has a unique shape that
allows only certain types of molecules to bind with it. A serotonin
molecule will only bind with a serotonin receptor for instance. A
dopamine molecule will only bind with a dopamine receptor. Once binding
occurs, the neurotransmitter completes a circuit, stimulating an
electrical current to flow along that neuron's axon, triggering the
release of more neurotransmitters.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Once the neurotransmitter molecule has delivered its message, it
detaches from the receptor. At this point, a number of things can
happen. The neurotransmitter can keep floating around the synapse until
it attaches to another receptor and triggers another signal. It can
float back to its original terminal, where it will be sucked back up
into a vessicle. This is known as re-uptake. Or, it can come in contact
with another type of protein molecule called an enzyme, which will break
it down to make it easier for the body to metabolize it.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[This system is complex and a number of things can go wrong. The supply
of a certain neurotransmitter stored in a vessicle may be too high or
too low. The pump that re-absorbs the neurotransmitter during re-uptake
may be defective, causing too few molecules to be re-absorbed. If this
happens, there isn't enough stored for release next time. Enzyme levels
can be too high and destroy many neurotransmitter molecules before they
reach the receptor, or cut up so many that there is none available for
re-uptake. Other kinds of molecules can block receptor sites, and
defective neurons may not have the right number or type of receptors. In
these cases, there may be enough neurotransmitter, but no parking spots
for them.]{.calibre7}

[Of the dozens of neurotransmitters already discovered, serotonin is
currently still believed to be one of the best targets for influencing
behavior problems. It is a neurotransmitter that is both important for
directly controlling moods and behavior, and also for acting as a master
chemical that regulates the activity of many other neurotransmitters. In
contrast to other neurotransmitters, which are concentrated in a few
specific areas of the brain, serotonin producing neurons are found in
many key locations, such as the limbic system, the part of the brain
that controls emotion and impulsivity. Serotonin has other effects
throughout the body. It is found in blood platelets as well as in the
digestive tract.]{.calibre7}

[Among the many conditions that are associated with low serotonin levels
are aggression, anxiety and depression. Manifestations of low serotonin
may vary from dog to dog, due to individual biochemistry and histories.

of nutrition and/or supplements.]{.calibre7}

[There are four basic types of drugs that have effects on the serotonin
system. The oldest type is the tricyclics such as amitriptyline
(Elavil). These work by reducing serotonin re-uptake (thus achieving a
higher net level of serotonin in the synapse). They also affect the
re-uptake of other important neurotransmitter systems and it is thought
that these other actions are what produce side effects reported in
humans such as dry mouth, nausea, increased heart rate, dizziness,
constipation, and fatigue. It is unknown exactly to what extent these
are present in dogs.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Another class of drugs is the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. They
work by slowing down the activity of the enzyme (monoamine oxidase) that
breaks down monoamine neurotransmitter molecules (like serotonin) as
they float around in the synapse. Just like tricyclics, MAO inhibitors
also act on other neurotransmitters and have a high risk of side
effects.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The third class of drugs is the serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SRI's).
They inhibit serotonin re-uptake, allowing more serotonin to be
available to bind to receptor sites. Drugs from this class that affect
only the serotonin system are known as selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitors (SSRI's). Examples are Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Luvox.
Because SSRI's affect just the serotonin system, they are thought by
many to be less likely to cause as severe side effects as tricyclics or
MAO inhibitors.]{.calibre7}

[There are a number of agents in new classes that have not yet been used
much in dogs, such as Wellbutrin. There is one drug, BuSpar (buspirone

anxiolytic agent that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to
benzodiazepines (like Valium and Klonopin), anti-depressants, or
barbiturates. It acts by boosting dopamine and noradrenaline while
reducing serotonin. Selegiline (Anipryl) is a MAOI that has been
successfully prescribed for canine cognitive disorder. Its action is to
increase dopamine while regulating pituitary ACTH.]{.calibre7}

[The body produces these brain chemicals from amino acids found in
proteins in food. To produce serotonin, the body converts the amino acid
tryptophan into 5-HTP, and then converts 5-HTP into serotonin. For
decades in the US, tryptophan (specifically the commercially
manufactured version, L-tryptophan) was used as a treatment for problems
associated with depleted serotonin. In 1989, an outbreak of EMS---a
serious immune response that killed nearly thirty people---was tracked
to tainted L-tryptophan supplements and the FDA banned it. Although the
EMS outbreak was traced to a single manufacturer whose production method
resulted in contamination, rather than to the use of L-tryptophan per
se, tryptophan remained off the market in the US, while still being
available in Canada. The tryptophan recall has since been re-evaluated,
and in the meantime, serotonin's more immediate precursor, 5-HTP, has
become increasingly popular. Tryptophan rich foods include bananas,
milk, grapefruit, and turkey.]{.calibre7}

[Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, has generated some
interest among dog people for the occasional management of separation
anxiety. It's important to note that the effects of long-term use of
melatonin are not known and so is never advised. The herb St. John's
Wort has been used for centuries in Europe to treat human depression.
There is some European evidence that the key ingredient, hypericin,
inhibits serotonin re-uptake in some people and that other compounds in
St. John's Wort, such as flavonoids, might provide other therapeutic
benefits. A problem associated with natural remedies is that their
quality is unregulated and their efficacy unclear. Dog owners are in an
even more uncertain situation as most of these remedies have next to no
published research about their effects in dogs.]{.calibre7}

like diced grilled chicken, freeze dried liver or pecorino Romano
cheese, something she never, ever gets in other contexts---I repeat, it
must be the good stuff). After repeating exposure at the reduced level

[To accomplish this, it's important you choose a period of time where
she won't have to actually go for a real visit. This would slow down
your progress. Then, get permission from your veterinarian to drop by a
couple of times a week, to hang out for half an hour or so. On the first
visit, you have to find the level your dog can cope with without any
trembling or panting. This will probably mean outside the door. Hang
around outside and, every few minutes, make a short trip with her into
the waiting room for a few seconds and then leave again to hang around
outside. Give her a few treats in the waiting room or, if she won't take
them there, right away once you get outside. Keep going in and out,
proving to her that nothing more is going to happen. The goal is for her
to learn that the trip to the waiting room means she's about to get a
treat (and not a shot!). As she relaxes and starts to like the game,
extend the amount of time in the waiting room. I recommend going from a
few seconds to ten seconds. Do several trials at ten until she is
clearly very interested in and anticipating the treat, as well as
exhibiting no trepidation about being there. Once this is solid, try
twenty seconds, then thirty, then a minute. From here go up in one
minute increments. When you can be in the waiting room for five or ten
minutes and she will happily take treats there, it's time to start
visiting the treatment rooms (you'll need permission from your vet for
this, however most vets are happy to have their dog clients worked on
this way).]{.calibre7}

[There still is and likely always will be a bona fide disorder called
separation anxiety. I think your trainer friend might have a finger too
strongly adhered to the pulse of popular media, which brought sep-anx
into people's living rooms via a couple of high profile segments on
prime time television shows some years ago. Shortly thereafter,
everybody's dog who misbehaved when alone had separation anxiety.
Inevitably, a backlash ensued: no, no, stop being so new-agey, they
don't have separation anxiety, they're just being naughty.]{.calibre7}

[Throughout these popular pendulum swings, behavior counselors in the
trenches continued to diagnose and treat problems of both stripe. The
truth is that owner-absent problems---specincally, some combination of
destructiveness, vocalization, and house-soiling---can occur in dogs who
are just being dogs and killing time while alone, or in dogs with
separation anxiety, a severe disorder with a specific treatment
approach.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5

:::

::: calibre17
[The tricky bit is that the two problems can present similarly. For
instance, the fact that the dog misbehaves solely when left alone can be
a feature of both garden-variety misbehavior and sep-anx. As Ian Dunbar
has pointed out, dogs without anxiety disorders quickly learn that their
owners attack them when they chew or eliminate in the house. This can
backfire if the dog becomes inhibited about eliminating or acting like a
dog in the owner's presence at all. The result is a dog that desperately
holds on to bladder and bowels while on walks and then, once the owner
leaves, relieves himself. The owner may then interpret the problem as
spite at being left alone and then punish the dog on their arrival home.
This ultra-late punishment can have the ironic effect of contributing to
a bona fide anxiety disorder, as it is crazy-making to be punished
dozens if not hundreds of behaviors after the fact. The dog now has two
reasons to eliminate when alone: it's the only time it's safe to do so
and his panic attack makes him lose bladder and bowels. This same
vicious cycle can play out for chewing.]{.calibre7}

[Part of our enchantment with dogs is their capacity to bond. The idea
has been floated that separation anxiety is a form of hyper-bonding. In
support of this is the observation that separation anxiety is often
triggered by a temporary disruption in owner access. Experiences such as
being boarded for extended periods, the death or departure of a key
family member, and re-homing often kick it off. The theory is that when
a susceptible dog has an important bond broken and then has a subsequent
opportunity to re-bond, the new bond is tighter, desperately so. Not all
dogs are susceptible---in fact, most never develop separation anxiety,
sailing through potential trigger experiences. It's currently impossible
to identify susceptible animals in advance. Another interesting fact
about separation anxiety is that it is typically presented without other
behavior problems. Sep-anx dogs are often model dogs when they're not

[Hugh's doorframe destruction and bleeding paws strongly suggest
separation anxiety. You can firm up his diagnosis with an anorexia test
and consideration of whether there is any pre-departure anxiety evident.
Another way to firm up a tentative or unsure diagnosis is to videotape
the dog for the first hour (often the worst time) while alone, to
witness whether he's having a good time or a panic attack. The onset of
Hugh's sep-anx being after a boarding stay is classic.]{.calibre7}

[There is a behavior modification procedure with an excellent track
record for separation anxiety. And, one good piece of fallout from the
popularization of the diagnosis is the increased availability of
medications to use along with the behavior modification. Next we'll look
at treatment using this two-pronged approach.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[The goal of treatment is for the dog to be able to be left alone
without anxiety. There is no controversy regarding what does and doesn't
work in this regard. Punishing dogs for misbehaviors stemming from the
anxiety---whether after the fact punishments or somehow well timed---is
ineffective and inhumane. Routine behavior problem management, such as
use of confinement, and increased exercise and stimulation, usually
can't dent severe separation anxiety once it's up and running. The
treatment of choice is desensitization and counter-conditioning (D&C) to
owner departures. It's been reported that D&C is more successful when
supplemented with a program of structuring interactions with the dog so
that he must perform a simple command before being fed, having a door
opened for him, being patted or given attention, so it is worth adding
to the regime.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Desensitization is a technique originally developed for people with
phobias. It has since also proven useful for dogs with certain fear and
aggression problems. In the case of separation anxiety, desensitization
involves exposing the dog to a length of absence that he can handle
without any anxiety and then gradually increasing that length up a
carefully constructed hierarchy. The dog is successful every step of the
way, so, in well-executed desensitization, at no point does the dog
experience the original anxiety.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Counter-conditioning, an application of Pavlovian conditioning, is
usually used in conjunction with desensitization. Dogs who have negative
emotions about something (in this case, being left alone) can have a new
emotional response conditioned to counter the existing distress.
Successful D&C changes the dog's association with alone time from The
Abyss to No Problem (desensitization) and Actually Kind of Good
(counter-conditioning).]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Dogs with separation anxiety usually succumb to panic attacks within a
few minutes to half an hour of their owners' departures, so the length
of absence on the first rung of the hierarchy must be under this. The
procedure is quite simple: the owner rehearses many absences under the
dog's anxiety threshold. If the dog continues to demonstrate no angst
before departures and minimal interest in returns, the training is on
safe ground and the next level can be commenced.]{.calibre7}

[To condition a new, relaxed and happy association, a novel and enticing
chew-toy, such as a stuffed Kong^™^, can be supplied prior to each
departure and removed upon arrival. Along with its potency as a
counter-conditioning stimulus, such a toy comes to signal: "don't
worry---this absence will be of a length you can handle" to the dog
(especially helpful for Plan B, below). It also provides a useful gauge
of whether the dog has crossed the anxiety threshold. Not all owners are
skilled at reading signs of low-grade anxiety, so it's useful to provide
owners the clearer task of judging whether the dog is all over the
Kong.]{.calibre7}

[Many dogs with separation anxiety start descending into anxiety during
the owner's getting-ready-to-leave routine. In these cases, the owner
must commence desensitization to the cues that kick off the anxiety
before attempting absences of even a second or two. These tip-off cues
might be late in the sequence---owner picking up keys or reaching for
door; or early---owner rising early, showering, and putting on work
clothes (which predicts an absence), rather than sleeping in (which
predicts the owner being home at least for a while). Once the dog is
desensitized to pre-departure cues, the absences can begin, using the
template above.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The ideal is for the dog to not experience absences over his anxiety
threshold for the duration of treatment. This means never leaving the
dog alone for longer than has been reached in treatment sessions to
date. For many owners this is not at all realistic, and for these cases
we go to Plan B.]{.calibre7}

[If the dog must sometimes be left alone for longer than he can
tolerate, a clear distinction has to be made to---with luck---protect
the progress in treatment sessions. The dog needs to be able to tell
safe (treatment) length absences from anxiety-eliciting (unavoidable
over-threshold length) absences in day to day life. If the same
"picture" leads sometimes to the safe length absence and sometimes not,
the former is poisoned by the latter and the anxiety disorder remains.
To avoid this, don't lie to the dog---if it's going to be an
anxiety-eliciting length of absence, signal it ahead of time. If it's
going to be under threshold, signal this. The counter-conditioning Kong
can help in this regard along with varying the routine to further help
the dog discriminate.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[For example, in a case I worked on a few years ago, the dog's owners
put a plexiglas barrier over the front door prior to departures to
minimize the damage to the moldings around the door as well as protect
the dog. This became a cue to the dog that he was about to be left
alone. These particular clients were unable to completely eliminate
too-long absences for the duration of treatment. So, when they were
exiting for an unavoidable, over-threshold length of time, they put up
their Plexiglas as usual. When they were practicing their D&C exercises,
they did not put up the Plexiglas, and provided a stuffed Kong. Over
time, the safe, treatment "picture" predicted sessions with absences of
a length that enabled the clients to live their normal life, so they
simply threw out their Plexiglas. Life had become the safe session. The
drawback to Plan B is that it doesn't work in all cases. Some dogs
simply do better if they are protected from having any more panic
attacks at all.]{.calibre7}

[The odds of success in treatment of separation anxiety can be improved
by using anti-anxiety medications in conjunction with the behavior
modification outlined above. One drug, a tri-cyclic antidepressant,
clomipramine hydrochloride (Clomicalm), has passed FDA standards for
safety and efficacy for the treatment of separation anxiety in dogs.
Other agents, such as amitriptyline (Elavil, also a tri-cyclic) and
fluoxetine (Prozac, in the SSRI class) are also used, but their usage is
considered off-label, which can dissuade veterinarians from prescribing
them. All these medicines take up to six weeks to confer benefit, so a
decision must be made between the behavior practitioner, veterinarian,
and client, whether to start the D&C immediately while waiting for the
meds to kick in, or get the meds on board and up to blood level before
starting the behavior mod. Some veterinarians opt to use sedatives, on a
short-term basis at the beginning of treatment, to buy time for the
anti-anxiety drug to kick in. There have been some tantalizing reports
of melatonin, a pineal gland secretion given in supplement form, for
short-term management of over-threshold absences, however safety
(especially long-term) and efficacy research is yet to surface for
this.]{.calibre7}

[Dogs do discriminate, but not in all the ways that we do.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The word discriminate, when used in everyday conversation, usually
means considering a person or category of people to be less worthy and
then proceeding to treat them badly. In western society, discrimination
on the basis of race, sex, age, ethnicity, body size, or mobility is
considered universally repugnant and our laws and morals reflect this.
History does seem to have demonstrated that humans are prone to be
prejudiced, however, though whether it's through our biology or culture
(i.e., indoctrination and modeling) or both is a hot and far from laid
to rest topic.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The word discriminate also has a very precise, techie meaning in the
psychology of animal learning. An animal that can discriminate can tell
the difference between two or more things and then employ that ability
to respond differently. A dog who has learned that "sit" means "put rear
on floor" and "down" means "put rear and elbows on floor" is performing
an auditory discrimination. If the cues were hand signals, it would be a
visual discrimination. A rodent pest that has learned to avoid the smell
of poisonous bait discovered on a dead colleague is performing an
olfactory discrimination task.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Depending on its particular ecology, a given species of animal will
have more or less ability to discriminate using its various senses. For
example, many species of foraging birds have terrific visual
acuity---they can tell the difference between tiny pebbles and tiny
edible things. Dogs famously have amazing olfactory discrimination
ability, which is why they can be used to detect drugs, bombs, mines,
cancer, etc.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The extrapolation of responding to stuff that is not identical, but in
some way similar, to an original stimulus is known as generalization.
Let's say in an auditory discrimination task, a dog learns to associate
a tone at 400 Hertz with food, and so salivates when he hears the tone.
The dog doesn't salivate to the 1812 Overture or to just any old sound.
But a single tone at 450 hertz elicits some salivation response,
typically less than the response to 400 Hertz. Ditto the response to 350
Hertz tones. And then less still---but still somewhat---to 500 and 300
Hertz. As the frequency departs from the original trained stimulus, the
degree of responding drops off in a lovely bell curve known as a
generalization gradient.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[We humans are master generalizers. For instance, we will place solidly
in the category "men with beards" men with goatees, blond beards,
wizard-y gray beards, a photo of a man with a beard, and Santa Claus. In
fact we're more likely to place Santa in the category with a goateed man
than a woman with an identical goatee to the man, even if her height,
weight and hair style were identical to a given man with a beard.
Language gives us the ability to employ specific parameters as the
relevant to the criteria defining a category, and these parameters can
be astoundingly abstract (ponder for a minute the category "geeks").
Dogs don't have nearly this degree of flexibility with regard to how a
category is defined. They do pretty well on demographics, however, which
brings us back to your question.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[It's not been researched, but it's the overwhelming experience of dog
owners that dogs readily employ sex, race, and age to categorize people.
But although dogs discriminate---tell the difference
between---categories of people, their category specific reactions are
not governed by value judgments the way ours often are. The kind of
cognition necessary to categorize people based on abstract concepts like
moral superiority, being in the "right" religious or ethnic group, or
aligned with one's own values are likely unique to humans. Dogs
categorize on two bases:]{.calibre7}

[Some dogs, through selective breeding, are extremely sociable toward
new people regardless of category. Other dogs, also through selective
breeding (sometimes deliberately and sometimes by a failure of
omission), are socially neophobic to some degree---inclined to not be
sociable with new people, the degree sometimes being influenced by how
far a new person departs from the demographics of the dog's owner or
very familiar people (the peak of the dog's generalization gradient). If
a dog has never encountered men with beards (notably as a puppy), for
instance, and is a susceptible (prone to social neophobia) individual,
the dog may react fearfully or aggressively to men with beards. Ditto if
the dog has had bad experiences with men with beards. Double ditto if
the first time (i.e., novelty) a socially shy dog encounters a man with
a beard she has a bad experience. People are like dogs in this regard;
phobias can develop based on bad experiences and then generalize to
entire categories.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[So the bottom line is: dogs absolutely discriminate in the "can tell
the difference" way, but any untoward responding they do is not due to
"considering this group less worthy" or other high concept. This means
your colleague's dog isn't employing any value judgment about Asian
people. He's growling either because he didn't encounter enough of them
(especially as a puppy) and so is not socialized to them and/or had a
bad experience.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[A very likely mechanism for what might appear to us to be a dog
"picking up" her owner's prejudice is that owners who don't like certain
categories of people may avoid them, thus resulting in poor or
non-existent socialization to that category. Another possible, though
less likely mechanism, is Pavlovian conditioning. If the owner getting
stressed in the past makes the owner smell a certain way and that smell
has led to bad things for the dog, the dog would learn that that smell
predicts bad news. If the presence of certain types of people then
caused the owner to be stressed and smell that way, it's possible the
dog might then acquire a negative emotional response to that category of
people.]{.calibre7}

in how different the reality is from the public perception of how

discussion about dogs and public health is retarded by: 1) the lumping
of routine dog threat behavior and non-damaging bites together with the
extraordinarily rare events of fatalities and serious maulings (this is

dogs to everything from kitchen utensils and water buckets to strollers,
Christmas trees, balloons, and marbles. To these items they compare
favorably. They compare even more favorably to things like swimming

attacks are by comparing them to the "universal cliché" of being struck

lightning---not just struck by one, mind you---killed" than to be killed
by a dog or dogs. Considering that less than 20% of lightning strikes
are fatal, this makes being struck by lightning twenty-five times more
likely than being the victim of a fatal dog mauling. If the risk by
exposure is then considered---there is one dog for every four or five

encounter several people every day of their lives---dogs are almost

not trending upwards. The rate has remained astonishingly steady over
all the decades that records have been kept. Bradley surmises that this
may indicate that the floor has been reached, i.e., that the rate is as
low as it could conceivably get. In fact, she cautions that well-meant
swells to "do more" after every headline-grabbing incident might not
only do nothing (save robbing resources from elsewhere), but rock a boat
that is currently at rock bottom: "Basic systems theory teaches us that
it is perilous to change the system to eradicate the exception, and dog
bite deaths are about as exceptional as it gets. It is perilous because
when you change large scale situations to prevent extremely rare events,
you cannot even begin to predict what other aberrant, or even
widespread, events may pop up."]{.calibre7}

[When it comes to bites at the kitchen-injury level, however, dog bites
are relatively frequent. What do I mean by "kitchen-injury" level?
Injuries are classified on a scale from one to six, with Level One
defined as quick recovery with no lasting impairment and six defined as
likely fatal. Ninety-nine percent of all treated dog bites fall into the
"one" category. For comparison purposes, Bradley discusses falls, the
most common type of injury, which average a four rating, defined as
requiring weeks or months for full healing or some lasting minor

[So what about frequency? Based on inferences from the available
research, for instance, it is often quoted that half of all children
will be bitten by dogs at some point and that every human who lives to
the age of sixty will be bitten at least once. This qualifies low-level
dog bites as mundane events. Absurdly mundane, according to Bradley, who
points out that a huge proportion of adults will also nick themselves
with paring knives countless times during their lives, and that
"something close to 100% of kids fall off their bikes multiple times
without injury." What's amazing about dog bites is that we are grimly
trying to count them: "There is no other such phenomenon that anyone
even attempts to study when it doesn't produce physical harm." In other
words, no one talks about the paper-cut epidemic, the chef's knife
injury epidemic, or the falling in bathtub epidemic. Why do dogs get to

for what Glassner calls "cultural scapegoating." Bradley puts it well
when she notes that dogs (or perhaps their "irresponsible owners") might
qualify as "unambiguous villains that allow us to distance ourselves
from responsibility for the real problems in our society."]{.calibre7}

[Another reason for humans' exaggerated fear of dog bites is our
evolutionary heritage. Just as we inherited a craving for fat and sugar

environmental elements, such as animals with big teeth. These were
genuine and prevalent concerns back then. Now they are not, but we can't
seem to shake the feeling, nor replace it with one that would be more

[Dog behavior is an area with an astounding scarcity of scientific
research addressing basic questions such as how to predict future
behavior, aggressive and otherwise. This knowledge void has created
fertile ground for all manner of explanatory constructs and tests of
presumed immutable character traits. And, as you've found, professional
behavior counselors may have wildly diverse opinions and self-invented
classification systems, yet pass these off as gospel to their clients.
Imagine if dentists did it this way!]{.calibre7}

[There are, at present, no dog assessment procedures that are strong on
the two critical test evaluation yardsticks of reliability and validity.
Test-retest reliability is the achieving of a replicable result in
multiple administrations of the test over time. If I test a dog today
and again in a month, are the results the same? Inter-tester reliability
refers to the achieving of similar results on the test with different
testers. If three people conduct the same test on the dog, do they all
get the same results? Validity is the test's ability to predict behavior
in the real world. Given the notoriously weak track records of tests in
these areas, it's safe to say these consultants, and others who read a
lot into behavior evaluations and temperament tests, are on shaky ground
and ought to have been more circumspect. They may even be using
procedures that have not undergone reliability or validity testing at
all!]{.calibre7}

[You raise a behavior vs. personality question that has interesting
nature-nurture shades and I will defer that discussion in Section 6 on
Genetics and Evolution that follows. The other, more practical question
is that of prognosis assessment, i.e., how can one tell whether a dog
with an aggression problem is a good candidate for behavior
modification? With reliability and validity problems plaguing currently
available behavior tests, the other remaining avenue for prognosis
information is history-taking.]{.calibre7}

[History is usually obtained by client interview. The value of history
is that it gets at both context and trend. There's a saying that goes:
behavior predicts behavior. What a dog does today in a certain context
is the best predictor of what he will do in that same context tomorrow.
This is thought to be part of the reliability and validity obstacles in
behavior evaluations. Does a tester represent all people to a dog? Do
the test items adequately simulate real-life contexts? In the case of
history, these bases are better covered and, if trend is added to that,
predictions became firmer. What a dog did the last three weeks, three
months, or three years in a certain context is the best predictor of
what he will do in that same context tomorrow.]{.calibre7}

[The downside of history taking is reporting error. We have all heard
the stories of enacted events in law school auditoriums and the wildly
conflicting eye-witness accounts that ensue from the observing students,
all given with great self-assurance. In the case of the reporting of dog
bite incidents, this notoriously poor recall of critical event details
is potentially compounded by the strong emotions involved and any vested
interest an interview subject might have in subconsciously (or
consciously) either inflating or deflating severity. These factors must
always be kept in mind when taking history.]{.calibre7}

necessary to complement or confirm, direct observations in the real
contexts in which the problem occurs. This requires greater legwork than
a typical temperament test, but avoids those lethal testing problems. In

history is the only means one can utilize, as deliberately orchestrating
a bite is ethically too difficult to justify.]{.calibre7}

[As appealing as it is to humans to apply adjectives and labels to dogs,
a focus on observable, quantifiable behavior---what the dog is
doing---yields both modification strategies and objective means to
assess whether modification strategies are working. Let's look at bite
inhibition in more detail.]{.calibre7}

## [ [Bite Inhibition]{.bold1} ]{.calibre24} {#Oh_Behave_Do-mack_to_Pinker_split_090.html#calibre_pb_89 .calibre23}

::: calibre12
 
:::

::: calibre17
[Acquired bite inhibition is likely the most significant prognostic
indicator in aggression. What makes ABI so crucial a factor are ethics
and liability considerations. Should a dog being worked on re-offend
during or between treatment sessions, or post-treatment, ABI dictates
the degree of damage done to whoever is bitten. Given that 100% is hard
to achieve when it comes to behavior, there is thus a large ethical
responsibility to protect the owner and the public. The potential
liability to both owner and practitioner escalates astronomically when
dogs do significant damage when they bite, especially when this is known
ahead of time.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[With all the strides forward that have been made in the behavior
modification of aggression, altering ABI has proven virtually impossible
in an adult dog (there is some promising suggestion of influence on ABI
by the use of certain psychotropic medications, however this is not yet
well established). And, no studies exist on its acquisition, i.e., why
one dog bites softly and another with mutilating force under similar
circumstances. The generally accepted view in the dog behavior field is
that ABI is a result of a genetic predisposition combined with certain
early environmental influences. The key early influence is thought to be
interactions between puppies in a litter as well as subsequent
play-biting up to the age when the dog's permanent teeth are fully
erupted, between four and five months of age.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[If you observe a litter of puppies, their primary activity---when not
eating, sleeping, or eliminating---is biting other puppies. Their sharp
teeth inflict pain if a bite is too hard, in spite of the pup's weak jaw
muscles. Play is derailed---a rotten consequence for the hard
biter---and, over time, puppies learn to not bear down with full force
when biting. They rehearse this restraint over and over. Adult dogs are
then equipped to solve conflicts ritualistically rather than bearing the
expense of flat-out aggression in every encounter. ABI is thus the
cornerstone of aggression ritualization. Bite inhibition acquisition is
also believed to be part of the function of the ceaseless play fighting
that takes place in the young of other social predatory species, such as
hyenas.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[The current thinking is that if a puppy does not get adequate rehearsal
at biting softly, he is at risk of growing to adulthood without the
capacity to inhibit his jaw force when biting under duress. This means
that ABI can be installed in puppies, but not in adult dogs, which
elevates its priority level in puppy education curricula. The study that
cries out to be done is one where this hypothesis is tested out. A
design whereby puppies were divided into groups, one receiving standard
measures to address ABI and the other not, may be deemed unethical if
the study's result is thought to be somewhat pre-ordained, as the
control group would be deliberately set up to become hard-mouthed
adults. A safer study design would be retrospective: to take careful
histories of dogs with known adult ABI levels and correlate these with
the kinds of interventions they received as puppies.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The other oft-discussed factor is breed. Akitas, Chows and, to a lesser
extent, Springer Spaniels, for instance, are believed by some trainers
to be harder biters (and in the case of Akitas and Chows, low on
protracted warning). Again, no objective data to back this up. An
interesting question is whether some individuals in the thought-to-be
higher risk breeds are destined to have hard mouths regardless of
efforts exerted in puppy-hood or whether additional attention will
produce good ABI. My suspicion (and hope) is the latter. One of my
primary projects with my Chow, Buffy, was to work diligently on her ABI
as a puppy, and then to continue rehearsing her soft mouth with regular
dog-dog play sessions and regular dog-human play-wrestling sessions that
incorporate time out penalties for all bites that are not gentle. My
hope is that should she ever bite, it will be with
restraint.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[When presented with an adult dog, assessing ABI involves taking a
comprehensive history of all bites and noting who was bitten, on what
part of their body, through what kind of clothing and what degree of
damage was inflicted. Consider the difference in jaw pressure between an
eighty-pound dog biting the face of a five year-old child and leaving a
minor laceration and a lot of saliva and an eighty pound dog biting the
calf of a forty year old man through denim jeans and leaving contusions
that spread many inches beyond the margins of the bite. Phrases like a
bite "breaking skin" or "drawing blood" give inadequate information. In
the first case above, the dog "broke skin" and has good ABI, whereas the
second dog did not and has poor ABI. Pressure exerted is the key factor,
not "blood."]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[A complete bite history will usually yield a pressure trend. In many
cases, however, there are no or not many bites on record so ABI is
unknown. Some hints at ABI may be gleaned from a dogfight history and
play-biting history, though these are vastly inferior to the information
obtained from jaw pressure under duress with a person. Remember:
behavior predicts behavior. A dog with a long, colorful history of clean
(non-injurious) dogfights and regular bouts since puppy-hood of
playfully mouthing people (when invited of course---this is obnoxious
behavior to most people), is a rosier ABI prospect than one who injures
other dogs during scraps and has never mouthed a person softly. It would
be extremely valuable for behavior practitioners to know whether ABI is
specific to people vs. to dogs or whether one can extrapolate bite
severity information between these two targets. But, alas, this
represents yet another area of logical speculation rather than
scientific fact.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The final two areas of exploration in ABI assessment are the dog's
early history and hints about jaw restraint in the way the dog accepts
treats and cookies. Early history centers around whether the dog in
question engaged in regular enough play-biting of other puppies, such as
in his litter and at a puppy kindergarten class. Less favorable is a dog
that was sequestered until after his permanent teeth were all in or,
worst of all, was a singleton in his litter and thereafter did not
play-bite any puppies.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Dogs vary greatly in how gently they take tidbits from human hands.
Dogs who are very rough can have this modified with standard
consequence-type training. The treat is withheld after the barracuda
grab is marked with "ouch!" and the dog invited to keep trying again
until he takes it more gently. With repetition, the dog eventually gets
it right most of the time. This training, however, has no bearing on the
dog's jaw pressure when he bites under duress, the so-far unmodifiable
ABI. The question then is whether any ABI information can be gleaned
from the dog's initial tendencies when taking treats. I don't know very
many knowledgeable practitioners who would bet much either way
here.]{.calibre7}

[It is indeed alarming for most people to see frank aggression in
puppies. In the case of resource guarding---food, bone, bed
possessiveness---there is good news and bad news. The good news is you
can start addressing it in a young, hopefully plastic, spongy puppy with
weak jaws. The bad news is that there is some sentiment out there among
trainers that aggression in puppies is an insidious sign of the problem
having Deep Genetic Roots and therefore fruitless to tackle. I'm going
to explore the whole nature-nurture debate a little later, but for now
will simply say that there doesn't seem to be any overwhelmingly tidy
correlation between behavior problems that are thought to have a strong
genetic component and their susceptibility (or lack thereof) to behavior
modification.]{.calibre7}

[I recently had a similar case with my own foster puppy. Buffy, then a
stray six week-old Chow, presented with object and food guarding against
people and dogs. I elected not to touch the dog-dog issues, which is a
relatively common approach. Her socialization and play skills were
coming along nicely and she was developing good acquired bite
inhibition. The guarding against people, however, needed to be actively
resolved. The following is a summary of Buffy's food guarding exercise
regime. Incidentally, Buffy also presented with socialization deficits
and severe body handling problems, which were also addressed, as was her
object guarding. The key to good hierarchy design is small enough
incremental steps that at no point do you see the original guarding
problem. In the case of a puppy such as this, there may actually be more
aggressive increment jumps. I did a few other things in the
can't-hurt-might-help category. These included impulse control (stay,
off, and wait) and extra soft-mouth training.]{.calibre7}

[Buffy has had mostly a stellar year. No resource guarding with people,
no body handling problems, and she's even better with strangers than she
was last year, though a sudden approach and hand-reach of a new person
still causes a head-duck about half the time. Her dog-dog interaction is
the same as it was at age three: she is more selective about playmates
than she was when she was younger and has the occasional posturing
incident or resource-related scrap with another dog. No dogs were hurt
during these spats with the exception of a foster Pomeranian I had who
sustained one puncture to his withers. The dog had a pre-existing skin
condition and so ended up with an infection at the puncture site, which
was an ordeal. Since then I am more cautious with her around small dogs.
I did not work on her resource guarding, however she is remaining a
non-guarder so still can't be a "case" for an Academy student to work
on. I also admit to not working on her as diligently as I might in the
other areas this year, with the exception of occasionally using her as a
demo dog for various training exercises. I'll report back in a
year.]{.calibre7}

with most new people she meets. Her body handling---with the exception
of nail-clipping (doesn't threaten or bite me, but is
Non-Compliant)---is really good. Loves brushing and combing, being
scissored, having her teeth brushed, ears cleaned, being pilled, vet
exams, pretty much anything. Jumps on the grooming table on a Good Knees
day. It's a reminder to me that a little effort can go a long way if you
have the luxury of working on a young puppy. She is mostly good with the
scores of dogs she encounters every week, mostly doing cordial
investigations, very occasionally playing. She has an evil streak which
manifests as occasional over-rough play and occasional ambushing of dogs
using toys or bones as bait or just for the sheer naughtiness of it. A
couple of minutes of time out and she rethinks this sport usually for a
good couple of months before again "buffing" some dog.]{.calibre7}

worthy things to cram into the time allotted. You've hit the major bases
beautifully and I love the idea of including some anti-aggression
exercises, as odds are that some puppies in every class might start
guarding at some point. It's a fair assumption that early intervention
will either stave it off or help create smoother sailing in a treatment
regime later on. Plus, if the owners have seen it done in a demo and

an extended demo where you also work in a down-stay, makes a strong
impression. As soon as possible, fade out any visible food lures, while

::: calibre17
[It surely is a sign of a conscientious rescue group that they not only
screen dogs and prospective adopters, but fully disclose the warts of
the breed they rescue. All breeds have problems and, in the case of Pit
Bulls, the ugliest is the potential for "gameness," a strong propensity
to fight with other dogs. Whether this genetic predisposition is present
in an individual dog can be difficult to predict. This is because of
genetic drift in most lines away from the breed's original function. Pit
Bulls were originally bred for bull-baiting and dog-fighting around the
turn of the last century, and there was strong selection pressure at
that time for the suite of characteristics that made a superior
specimen: off the charts pugnacity with other dogs, unwillingness to
back down in a fight, failure to read appeasement gestures from other
dogs admitting defeat, the characteristic body type and, interestingly,
a strong inhibition against redirected bites to humans meddling in the
fight. This last quality comes as a surprise to many people who have
been swayed by the spectacular media coverage of Pit Bull attacks
against people. While aggression to other dogs is central to correct
breed type, aggression to people is anathema.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[In more recent times there has been massive random ("backyard")
breeding of Pit Bulls. Once the selection pressure for game
characteristics was lifted in favor of size, look, or nothing in
particular, the genetic cards were shuffled. So whether some, none, or
all of the characteristics of a fighting dog will be present in an
individual animal is impossible to tell until the dog is socially
mature. This is because there are two onset periods. One is eary---often
evident while the puppy is still in its litter, relentlessly fighting
with siblings in a fashion that is much, much more intense than the
play-fighting that all normal puppies engage in.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The second group of game animals present normally as puppies and as
young adults. Then, in spite of extensive socialization to other dogs
and normal play skills, gameness creeps in sometime between age one and
three. This is the reason your rescue group is being prudent about
whether your dog is out of the woods with regard to dog-dog aggression.
And, as they point out, this quality is completely unrelated to the
dog's disposition toward people.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[How to rehabilitate game-bred dogs is a fascinating question. It is of
course a different question from whether such behavior modification
should be attempted. The position of most responsible Pit Bull groups is
that dogs with propensities to fight should be tightly managed, i.e.,
diligently kept away from opportunity. In my opinion, this is the best
approach in terms of both safety and efficiency. But rather than explore
the ethics or cost-benefit merits of approaching such dogs with behavior
modification, I'm going to focus on the technical aspects of a
rehabilitation performed by a trainer at The San Francisco
SPCA.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The dog in question was an apparent Pit Bull-Chow cross that came into
the shelter four years ago. While stellar with people, she attacked any
dog within sight and in the relentless fashion characteristic of game
dogs. There was no social behavior whatsoever directed at dogs. The
choices appeared to be: 1) carefully adopt her out to a remote home with
strong admonitions to the adopter about the results of dog encounters;
or 2) euthanize her. One of our trainers, Kim Moeller, who had worked on
more routine dog-dog aggression problems before, pitched the idea of
taking a few months to work on her. The prospect of gaining
knowledge---success or no---was too great to pass up, so everyone was
supportive of her plan.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[A key question when approaching aggression cases of any kind is that of
whether the dog is "upset," i.e., whether there is any component of
fear, anxiety, or other negative emotion. If the answer is yes, it
behooves the trainer to have classical counter-conditioning, the
replacement of that emotion with a more favorable one, as part of the
agenda. But if the answer is no, straight operant conditioning, the
manipulation of consequences contingent on specific target behaviors, is
the way to go. Because a plausible case could be made both ways in the
case of severe dog-fighting, Kim decided to both build a favorable
conditioned emotional response (CER) and employ negative punishment for
the worst outbursts of aggression.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Those well acquainted with applied behavior analysis will see a paradox
here. The desensitization and counter-conditioning (D&C) procedure,
wherein the dog is exposed to stimulus dogs at an intensity that does
not elicit aggression and the pairing of the presence of other dogs with
gobs of praise and extremely high value food, hinges on the presumption
that other dogs are a fear-evoking stimulus. If so, the D&C will make
gains. And, if so, any negative punishment, which would be removing her
from the situation, should actually function as a negative reinforcer.
Removing someone from something that scares them should be a reinforcing
event, not a punishing one. And, if it was a punishing event, it is a
"liked" stimulus and so there should be no need for D&C!]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Interestingly, both techniques seemed to pay dividends: the dog
improved. The key desensitization hierarchy variables turned out to be
the stimulus dog's novelty to her, the stimulus dog's degree of
animation, and how "warmed up" our Pit-Chow was. Until she was very
advanced, the first trial of the day was always dicier than mid-session
and late in the session trials, independent of the other parameters. And
so, early in training, the stimulus dog would be familiar to her and
passive. Less familiar dogs and novel dogs were introduced late in the
session and the dogs would be passive or kept still.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Gradually, these parameters were edged up independently and,
eventually, piled up. Another element that varied was the degree of
mechanical control. In early training and at key raises in stimulus
intensity, she wore a (pre-desensitized) secure muzzle, a Gentle Leader
head collar and was on a six-foot leash. In the earliest sessions, she
would charge the stimulus dog at any level of stimulus intensity. Kim's
strategy was to physically prevent the attack using these physical
controls and then supply the broad praise and food (remember, this is a
classical technique---the food is not contingent on her behavior, but
rather on the presence of the stimulus dog). Over time, as so often
happens in these cases, the presence of the stimulus dog caused her to
anticipate the food and orient to the handler from whom the food would
be coming, rather than charge the dog. At this point the variables above
came into play.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Around this time, time outs were applied for charging. This brings us
back to our apparent paradox. Why would removal from the situation be
punishing? It is possible that, by this point, the sessions were a
welcome diversion to her and a source of praise and treats. Being
marched back to her kennel therefore functioned as a strong punisher.
It's also possible the kennel was stressful and so an element of
positive punishment crept in. And, it's possible that for a fighting
dog, being removed from dogs is a punisher and so the technique would
have worked well right off the bat. But if this is the case, then D&C
should have been ineffective. A possible answer here is that she was
being desensitized to attack triggers such as novelty and movement,
rather than to dogs as a fear-evoking stimulus per se.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Six months into the training she began playing with other dogs. We were
all floored. Her social circle was carefully expanded, the physical
controls lifted, and she was adopted out with full disclosure and a lot
of post-adoption support. Amazingly, her gains held on follow-up and to
this day she regularly attends dog parks without incident.]{.calibre7}

[Given this history, I think this was an example of what Ian Dunbar has
coined predatory drift. It's worth summarizing what predation is before
examining predatory drift.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Although often lumped under the banner "aggression," predation is food
acquisition rather than agonistic (fisticuffs within a species) or
defensive behavior, although some of the behaviors in the canine
predatory sequence---most notably biting---share some topography with
aggression. Predatory behavior warrants careful attention because the
results are more often extremely damaging than the results of routine
defense and competition.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Some dogs display frank predatory behavior toward other dogs the same
way they might toward squirrels, cats, and other critters. Most such
dogs direct regular social behavior toward dogs on other occasions or
confine their predation to small dogs, or running dogs only. Each dog
will have a profile, broad or narrow, of the targeted dogs and contexts
that elicit the behavior. There are also key divisions among these dogs
regarding which parts of the predatory sequence they are predisposed to.
For instance, a dog may be a maniacal chaser but demonstrate great
restraint if ever a prey item is caught (a Golden Retriever might
gleefully run down a squirrel but have no idea what to do with it once
it's caught---the squirrel, is presumably freaked out but unscathed).
Others are "finishers," i.e., they finish the predatory sequence by
killing what they catch. Terriers are the poster children for this
phenomenon although there may be over-representation of other breeds,
such as Siberians. As an interesting side note, this incredible genetic
elasticity in the dog predatory sequence has allowed for the
exaggeration through selective breeding of many of our favorite stylized
predation behaviors such as scent-work, pointing, flushing, and
herding.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Dogs who are known finishers are best managed (kept away from
opportunity). I would also elect to manage dogs that are not known
finishers if they target small dogs. This usually manifests when the
latter are running or scurrying (retired racer syndrome). The risk of
injury is too high, the behavior harder than most to modify, and the
management usually easy to implement.]{.calibre7}

[I believe Henry's unfortunate incident was the result of an equally
serious, but less well-known phenomenon, predatory drift. Unlike regular
predation, which is motivated as such from the get-go, predatory drift
is the kicking in of predatory reflexes in an interaction that begins as
a social interaction. And, unlike predation, which is predictably
elicited in a known quantity by the presence of a member of the target
group, predatory drift can occur among dogs who had never been predatory
before and may never be again after. It kicks in because of specific
contextual triggers. The riskiest contexts are:]{.calibre7}

[Because predatory drift can occur in dogs without any particular
history, all owners and practitioners should exercise some diligence in
the two contexts above---large to small interactions and "double team"
(two+ vs. one). While it is quite true that many such interactions are
completely benign, predatory drift is common enough that most dog people
have either witnessed it or know someone who has. The risks multiply if
both factors are present. Another obvious factor that increases risk is
the involvement of a known predatory dog in the mix, especially a
finisher.]{.calibre7}

[The other night I was at dinner with a group of dog trainers and the
conversation turned to breed specific legislation. Now I must preface
what follows with the assurance that these were, without exception,
progressive-thinking and enlightened people, many of whom had been in
dogs for decades. All deplore hysteria-based, arcane laws banning
various breeds thought to be over-implicated in serious dog attacks, as
have been enacted in numerous jurisdictions.]{.calibre7}

[The question went around the table: if you ruled the world, would you
ban any breeds of dog and, if so, which? One might think that a
professional and wildly pro-dog crowd such as this would rise above our
breed biases and sagely and in unison intone that what we really needed
to ban was irresponsible dog ownership. But no. Within two and a half
minutes we had (enthusiastically) banned all breeds, with the following
exceptions:]{.calibre7}

[A couple of lobbying efforts were mounted to get some cherished breeds
in under the wire. For instance, someone pointed out that there were no
actual big dogs and then opened a negotiation for Newfoundlands. "I'll
give you your mini-Aussies, Papillons and Chinese Cresteds if you
instate Newfies." "No," a hold-out snapped back. "Newfies will require
those plus Standard Poodles. We need a non-shedding, no, the world needs
a non-shedding option. We don't need drooling." "Cresteds don't shed.
Forget it." And so Newfies were shot down and after more fierce, but
feckless bartering and impassioned pitches, the only other breed to
squeak in was Italian Greyhounds. The final smug consensus was that we
were, in fact, quite generous to give people the choice of ten breeds.
On a worse day, it might have ended up All Cavs All The Time. The spike
in breaking and entering alone gives one pause. And never mind the
Flyball teams.]{.calibre7}

[Interestingly, Pit Bulls were not in the first or even second wave of
breeds struck from planet earth. They came in around neck and neck with
other medium to large semi-caffeinated breeds. Those genius Border
Collies and darling, telegenic Jack Russells were the gold and silver
medalists of Let's Never Make Any More (the bronze was a dead heat
between Siberian Huskies and Akitas). We culled for high activity level,
we culled for anything remotely resembling drivey or compulsive
behavior, and we smote all breeds that were suspiciousness of strangers,
along with breeds frequently presented with refractory housetraining
problems, thus decimating the toys.]{.calibre7}

[I am by no means attempting to tar all dog behavior people with the
same brush. We were a small, cynical band of dog eugenicists gleefully
banning breeds as dark humor round the table that night, by no means
representative of dog people in general. At least I don't think so. I
would submit, however, that we overlap with virtually all dog people
insofar as we acknowledge that genes affect behavior. This notion is in
fact usually a no-brainer for anyone who knows dogs. Ray Coppinger
famously pointed out that it would be hard to imagine more divergent
MO's than those of flock-guarding breeds like Great Pyrenees and
flock-herding dogs like Border Collies. The former protect the flock
from predators and the latter move the flock by stalking them, just like
predators. No one seriously suggests that this is solely the result of
rearing practices.]{.calibre7}

[I admit I find it worrisome, the readiness with which we accept genetic
influence on behavior in general, but then flip 180-degrees to a
no-genes-ever-ever position when the question of breed specific
legislation (BSL) comes up. The only acceptable rallying cry seems to be
"it's entirely irresponsible ownership." It is undeniably true that
there is no credible evidence demonstrating over-representation of any
breeds in egregious aggression incidents. BSL fighters have rightly
drawn attention to the poor quality of the research. It is also
undeniably true that, as with all behavior, causation is and will always
be multi-factorial, i.e., a conspiracy of genes woven together with
environment. But what if credible research does come down the pike and
what if such evidence concludes that genetics is a factor? Not the only
factor, but a factor. What then?]{.calibre7}

[I wonder if part of our gene-o-phobia has to do with assessing blame.
For dog lovers and sympathizers, it is easier to place dogs in the role
of victim when failures of commission and omission during an otherwise
"good" dog's lifetime are at the root of anti-social behavior. However,
if it is the dog's "nature"---something in him, something he is born
with---he's evil. But wait a minute. The dog is no more in control of
the genetic cards he is dealt than he is in control of the owner he is
dealt. Sure, it's bad luck to draw an owner that knocks you around,
fails to socialize you, fails to train you, but it's no picnic to be
saddled with one hundred or more generations of selective breeding to
view unfamiliar humans as threatening or be unable to back down from a
fight.]{.calibre7}

:::

::: calibre17
[If ever evidence comes down---and it's no long shot---that genes
influence aggression the way they influence all behavior, we'll have the
non dog-loving public to face. "Yeah, sorry, we kind of knew genes
mattered in behavior but, hey, the crappy research on dog attacks and
blunt instrument of 'breed bans' were sure easy targets." We may get a
less than sympathetic ear, too, from owners who knocked themselves out
doing everything right with dogs whose genomes imposed a steel ceiling
on friendliness to strangers or other dogs. Many, many of these innocent
people were not issued much in the way of package warnings by whoever
produced their animals and so go on to blame themselves, aided and
abetted by our oh-it's-always-rearing anti-BSL war cry.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[If it comes down to this, our best shot at protecting breeds from being
banned would be to change the genes within breeds, so that they're not
at higher risk for aggressive behavior. But you can't change what you
don't acknowledge.]{.calibre7}

[Dog people are no exception when it comes to human fascination with the
question of environmental and genetic influences on behavior. The
mapping of the human genome and recent celebration of the 50th
anniversary of the discovery of the structure of DNA have redoubled
interest in genetic influences. Books such as Steven Pinker's [The Blank
Slate]{.italic} make an increasingly strong case for the impact of our
genes on everything from what diseases we are likely to get to what
kinds of spouses we are likely to marry. Pinker's ideas collide rudely
with what he calls the Standard Social Sciences Model (SSSM) of
behavior, i.e., the prevailing and politically correct view that we are
virtual blank slates and thus products of our culture, upbringing, and
environmental influences. What Pinker is urging is for us to rise above
what's known as the naturalistic fallacy, the mistaken idea that just
because something is a certain way in nature, it is therefore how it
ought to be ("natural" = "good"). If genetic influences exist and/or are
powerful, then morally legitimizing oppression, discrimination, or other
societal ills is the ill-founded fear. He also points out that the
monster in the closet for us may not so much be genetic determinism, but
determinism period, and that that one is inescapable. Behavior is
determined. Often complex, but always determined.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[There is actually good consensus among most scientists that there is no
"nature-nurture" dichotomy at all. All behavior is the product of a
complex interaction between genes and environment. Just as it is
meaningless to ask whether a rectangle is a product of its length or its
height, it is meaningless to ask whether a certain behavior is a product
of genes or the environment. The answer is always both. There is no such
thing as one on its own.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Interestingly, in the case of dog people, popular bias has historically
swung the other way. Our intimate familiarity with breeds and the
behavioral proclivities that stem from their original functions make too
strong a case for us to deny genetic influence. Border Collies have more
herding "instinct" than Newfoundlands, Pointers are keener bird dogs
than Bichons, and Labradors and Goldens are easier to socialize to
strangers than Chows and Akitas. The mechanism is said to be genes "for"
herding or hunting or suspiciousness of strangers. The reality is that
mechanisms are more complex. Genes are simply coded instructions to flip
other genes on or off and to manufacture proteins. They are turned on
and off during both embryonic development and throughout life. The
turning on and off function, interestingly, is not always under control
of other genes---it can be triggered by something in the environment.
The sex of crocodiles, for example, is determined by nest temperature
during the middle trimester of incubation. The genes specify the rules
governing sex determination, but the environment actually "chooses" the
sex. Labeling such a phenomenon the result of either genes or
environment is patently incorrect.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5

:::

::: calibre17
[More intriguing wrinkles about genetics and expressed traits were
raised a few years ago when scientists at Texas A&M successfully cloned
the first cat. One finding was that the cloned cat's coat markings
differed significantly from the donor cat. Although the two are
genetically identical, differences in the turning on and off of genes
during embryological development made for two quite different looking
cats. The mind boggles at the possible implications of this for brain
development and behavior. And, as though this weren't sufficiently
complex, consider the notion that the very environment that many think
of as the alternative to "genetic" influence was literally the selector
of those genes during the evolutionary history of the
animal.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Another interesting notion about mechanisms behind genetically wired
behavior was put forward by B.F. Skinner. He hypothesized that what is
genetically determined in animals is not necessarily a behavior, but the
capacity to be reinforced by a certain kind of event and that this, in
turn, impacts behavior. Ducklings are not hard-wired to follow a moving
stimulus, he argued, but hard-wired to be reinforced by proximity, which
then reinforces the behavior of following. Rabid Skinnerian thinking is
strongly out of fashion these days, but many of Skinner's ideas, such as
this one, suggest mechanisms to explore in gene-behavior interaction
research.]{.calibre7}

[Worries about Pinker's slippery slope of legitimizing something because
"it's natural" are also prevalent in dog behavior. For instance, there
is little agreement among people in dog behavior and training about
whether aggression is normal behavior or some sort of pathology. Part of
this debate is driven by a legitimate question---treatment strategies
may depend on whether there is disease present---but a larger part is, I
think, driven by the is/ought fallacy. For instance, I have personally
gone on record as saying that a significant percentage of aggression in
dogs is normal behavior. This statement is frequently misinterpreted to
mean that I therefore think it's okay for dogs to be
aggressive.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The more difficult fallacy to shake is that of the presumed
immutability of behavior with a strong genetic component. The bias among
most dog people is that behavior with an identifiable predominantly
environmental cause is much more plastic (modifiable) than behavior with
an identifiable predominantly genetic cause. This intuitive presumption
is actually very questionable. There does not seem to be a tidy
correlation between how much a behavior is influenced by genetic
predisposition and its susceptibility to behavior modification. All
kinds of behavior with massive genetic influence---grabbing sandwiches
off tables, puppy mouthing, urine marking, intolerance of physical
restraint, guarding resources---are routinely modified using standard
operant and classical conditioning.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The reason they are modifiable is that the ability to change one's
behavior due to environmental contingencies is also hard-wired. The
capacity to learn is itself genetic. This undermines to a large degree
the "it's genetic" line sometimes uttered when behavior modification
reaches a dead-end ("don't bother, it's genetic"). It could absolutely
be that genetic constraints have collided with behavior in many cases.
My sense, however, is that this platform is defaulted to in cases where
justification for giving up is needed in cases that go south. If the
owner, dog, and practitioner all need off the hook, genes can provide a
convenient explanation. My hope, however, is that as understanding of
the genetics-behavior connection and behavior mod techniques both
improve, this line will need to be trotted out less. There may even
emerge tactical insights to speed my Chow up at Flyball.]{.calibre7}

[These are superb questions. First, it's important to understand that
genes can't "make" behavior, especially complex behavior, any more than
a single engine part "makes" a car (though a malfunction of a gene can
derail behavior just as a faulty engine part can cause a car to break
down). Behavior is a phenotypic trait, i.e., it is an observable
characteristic of an animal. A phenotypic trait---including "hardwired"
or unlearned behavior---is always the end product of an interaction
between the animal's genes and the animal's environment. An animal's
genotype is the collection of all its genes, whether they are expressed
("visible") in the phenotype or not. How genes do their part starts with
the exact spot on the chromosome, called a locus, where the gene
resides. Two alleles, which are versions of each gene donated by each
parent, are at every locus. The relationship between the two alleles may
be additive, which means the phenotype is intermediate between the two.
As a hypothetical example, imagine breeding a dog with high drive for
toys to a dog with low drive and the offspring are moderately drivey for
toys.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The relationship between alleles can also be dominant-recessive to
varying degrees, where one allele is expressed in the phenotype and the
other, though present and transmissible to offspring, is nearly or
completely silent. This is the Mendelian inheritance taught in many
biology classes, with eye-color in humans the classic example. To answer
your question about whether single genes can influence behavior, the
answer is "yes," with the operative word being "influence." Complex
traits, such as behavior, are better understood as the product of the
actions and interactions of many, many genes. Such traits are called
polygenic, which means each individual gene makes up only a small part
of the genetic contribution to the trait. Body size is a well-known
polygenic trait. Polygenic traits can be additive, as in body size or
they can be epistatic, where the product is not intermediate between the
genes involved, but rather is more analogous to the dominant-recessive
relationship that exists at individual loci. Coat color heredity in many
breeds of dog is a familiar example of a phenotypic trait that is
governed by epistasis.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Remember, it's far from over once a set of genes are turned on or off.
Genes interact with the environment to result in the final phenotypic
product, the body part or behavior that we can see. Even body size,
though largely polygenically determined, is somewhat influenced by
environmental influences like nutrition, illness, etc. In the case of
behavior, environmental interactions often play a larger role. For
example, famous research on mice bred for high aptitude at running
mazes---maze bright mice---and mice bred for low aptitude---maze dull
mice---also found that rearing the maze dull mice in a more complex and
stimulating environment compensated for their maze dull genes and they
performed as well on mazes as maze bright mice.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Environment not only interacts with genes, but can directly affect
their activity---it can literally turn them on and off! In fact, about
95% of genes that code at all don't code for proteins on the road to
phenotypic traits, but rather regulate the action of other genes. Most
of these regulatory genes respond to environmental triggers, which
prompt them to turn the protein coding genes on and off, both in utero
when the organism is being built, during post-natal development, and
right on into adulthood. In other words, genes don't provide recipes in
stone on how to build bodies and behave to organisms so much as they
participate in a give-and-take process with environmental signals
throughout life.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Regulator genes may very well send instructions to genes that are
themselves regulator genes. Eventually, further downstream, genes are
turned on that will build proteins, specifically enzymes. Enzymes then
affect cellular metabolism, which in turn affects other cells. At the
end of this chain reaction comes the tiny chemical increments that make
up the genetic part of the genetics-environment cocktail that is
behavior.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[An interesting result of this string of events, all kicked off by a
particular regulator gene, is that a single gene can have two or
more---sometimes many more---effects! This is called pleiotropy and is
quite different from polygenic effects, where multiple genes contribute
to one effect. A famous example of pleiotropy occurred during the
Russian fox domestication experiment where strong selection for reduced
flight distance also produced floppy ears, curled tails, shorter
muzzles, and occasionally, even white markings on the coat.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[There are different flavors of pleiotropy. For instance, one regulator
gene can kick off chain reactions in multiple metabolic pathways in
different body systems. Pleiotropy can also occur if a gene sits right
next door to another unrelated gene on a chromosome and then both stick
together when cut and pasted into the new generation.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[So how do we know its genes? The way genes influence behavior can be
teased out of the gene-environment interaction in a variety of ways.
Even before the advent of molecular genetics, animals with identical or
near-identical genotypes were studied in different environments, and
animals with different genotypes were studied in identical or
near-identical environments. These measures did a reasonable job of
controlling for environmental effects. The serendipitous (for science)
"experiment" of comparing human identical twins separated at birth
yielded revealing data about the effect of genes on
behavior.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Direct study of the presence or absence of specific genes and how this
impacts behavior is now possible too. Because it is so unlikely that
single genes will be found that have profound behavioral effects,
researchers concentrate their search for sets of genes that each make
their small contribution to a certain behavior. Also, most behavior
traits are distributed in a continuous rather than "digital" fashion,
which strongly implies multiple genes. For example there isn't an on-off
switch for "anxiety" that effectively divides dogdom into dogs
completely without a predisposition and those completely
riddled.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Research that attempts to link the presence of gene suites with
elevated occurrence of certain traits in families can be confounded by
partial dominance effects and the fact that the same traits may be
brought about by different genetic routes. Scans of full genomes can
narrow the search if there is a marker residing in close proximity to a
candidate gene that is suspected to be associated with a certain trait.
The spot on the genome of a control group without the trait is then
compared to the same spot on the genome of the group with the
trait.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre5

[Experiments can really ice the cake when it comes to nailing down which
genes do what. For example, once a suspect gene has been identified, it
can be "knocked out" of the genome of mice with genomes that are
otherwise identical to a control group of mice and then the two groups
compared in minute detail. Transgenics, where genes from another animal,
such as a human, are spliced in to an experimental animal is also a
fruitful way to directly observe the effects of genes on behavior, body
type, and body function. When all these methods converge on the same
conclusion, the evidence for the effects of certain genes is extremely
compelling.]{.calibre7}

[Both you and the author of your book may be correct. There are two
kinds of answer to "why does he do that?" questions. One kind, called
"immediate" or "proximate" causation, involves the hormonal,
neurochemical, and sensory precursors and consequences of behavior, such
as "enjoying" something. The other kind, called adaptive significance,
involves the advantage provided by such hormones, neurochemistry, and
sensory apparatus in the environment the animal evolved in. Your or my
dog might enjoy chewing, but why does she enjoy it? And why doesn't she
"enjoy" 120-degree heat? These ultimate answers are always some
variation on the theme, "because they contributed to the fitness of the
animal in the environment it evolved in." And so, chewing serves some
adaptive function in dogs. Finding high heat aversive and thus avoiding
it was also selected for.]{.calibre7}

[When animals behave, they are not driven or triggered in a conscious
way by the evolutionary advantage of their behavior, but by the various
mechanisms that evolved to serve that end. During evolution, brains that
happened to reward dogs when they chewed helped the bodies they were in
have slightly better teeth than bodies with brains that didn't happen to
reward them when they chewed. The chewing dogs didn't consider or
celebrate their slight reproductive advantage. They were busy being
rewarded by their brains for chewing. (Incidentally, those same brains
evolved mechanisms to respond to environmental contingencies in a
flexible way, which we call learning, and you could exploit this module
to condition your dogs to like that toothbrush more.)]{.calibre7}

[We've all heard the phrase "good of the species" in wildlife
documentary narrations. It appeals to human intuition, but is it
correct? Consider an animal whose genes tell him to do some behavior for
the "good of the species," let's say throwing himself off a cliff if
food supplies are poor one year so that there is more to go around for
the rest of his species. Compare him with an individual in the same
species whose genes tell him not to throw himself off a cliff, but to
eke out as best he can and do his utmost to reproduce. Note that the
throw-oneself-off-a-cliff gene does not get passed on whereas the
hang-in-there-while-someone-else-throws-themselves-off-a-cliff gene
proliferates. Soon the population is filled with
non-suicidals.]{.calibre7}

[Then, what about cats going into burning buildings? How is this
benefiting the selfish genes of the cat? The answer lies in the concept
of inclusive fitness---the sharing of genes between related animals.
Genes do exist for altruistic acts---acts directed at saving copies of
the same gene housed in another individual. The degree of genetic
relatedness dictates the likelihood and intensity of altruistic acts
across all species. The cat going into the burning building is saving
her kittens, in whose bodies are copies of the very genes that are
telling her to do this. They are saving themselves.]{.calibre7}

[In the words of ethologist Richard Dawkins, organisms are survival
machines built by genes to move themselves through time. If you give up
your own life to save two offspring (each of whom share, on average, 50%
of your genes), eight cousins, or your own identical twin, it's a wash
from the genes' point of view. If you remain alive while saving them,
the gene team is ahead. Of course no one considers these things when
they do heroic acts. The mechanisms built by genes to serve this end are
bonding, love, and the stuff of which great movies are made.]{.calibre7}

[These same altruistic mechanisms can misfire. I would likely go into a
burning building to save my spayed Chow. This is rather bogglingly poor
use of parenting resources on many levels. And Lassie got Timmy out from
under the tractor. These kinds of fascinating examples notwithstanding,
during evolution, the kin selection shotgun got it right enough of the
time for the capacity to bond to those around us to have been strongly
selected for.]{.calibre7}

[All of this becomes even more wrinkly when we consider a domesticated
species like dogs, where we humans are, in many instances, selecting
mates and, when the animals will not breed, facilitating this with
everything from holding bitches still to artificial insemination. We
also intervene in the pregnancy, delivery, and rearing, especially when
these go awry. Because of this, some of the mechanisms that evolved in
the original evolutionary environment that produced the wild precursors
of dogs may be muddled up. The selection pressures are now quite
different.]{.calibre7}

[Such interventions by humans are sometimes criticized as meddling with
nature and creating non-viable animals. But this overlooks a most
interesting point, which is that genes don't care whether they are
making it to the next generation by virtue of being in an organism that
maximizes its fitness with adaptations that put it on the cover of a
David Attenborough video or in an organism that makes a living releasing
care-giving behavior in humans (or herding their sheep, or guarding
their property).]{.calibre7}

enlisted the care and support of humans. So, if you're a gene, you're

[Ray Coppinger points out the wild disparity between the behavioral
predispositions of herding dogs and flock guarding dogs, one preying in
stylized fashion on stock and the other defending the same stock against
predators. There is a certain facility to "training" Pointers to point
or "training" Border Collies to herd as so many individuals in these
breeds not only find the behaviors enormously self-reinforcing, but do
them with the particular style that their lines have been bred for.
Rather than shaping behavior by selecting it in real time with
reinforcers and punishers, breeding shapes behavior over generations by
selecting (reinforcing) and culling (uh, punishing) genes. Subsequent
tweaking of performance is then most efficiently obtained by allowing
these self-reinforcing activities to continue when the animal is
performing as desired or cutting off opportunities to continue
contingent on undesired aspects. It's hard-wiring and operant
conditioning rolled elegantly into one.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[When it comes to behavior modification or training of tasks that are
not heavily weighted toward a specialized breed (such as herding,
pointing or going to ground), however, the playing field becomes more
level. All breeds are endowed with that most interesting adaptation,
plasticity, which allows changes to one's behavior based on
environmental contingencies encountered during the course of an
individual's lifetime. The adding of sits, downs, and heeling on cue,
and the removal of jumping up, pulling on leash, guarding bones, and
urinating on carpets rely on laws of learning that are universal to
vertebrates (and the many invertebrates that have been examined). Where
breed comes into play here is in selection of reinforcers and style of
performance. Keen trainers are drawn to high-drive dogs, who can be
motivated to perform in intense and highly animated fashion by prey-type
reinforcers like balls and tug toys. These same dogs tend to do poorly
in pet homes where the same unexploited and unchanneled drive translates
into chaos and mayhem.]{.calibre7}

[Historically, breed did make a greater difference in obedience training
due to traditional training methods that relied heavily on the use of
aversive motivators. Whereas some breeds tend to respond to aversives
appeasingly, which does not hamper and, arguably, helps the training
process, others have a fight/flight/freeze default that can derail
training altogether.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Another significant difference between breeds of dog seems to be the
ease with which they can be socialized to people. Though all dogs become
relaxed and affiliative with family members and people they see often
enough, comfort around unfamiliar people varies significantly from dog
to dog and trends between breeds seem apparent. Clues to possible
mechanisms behind this can be gleaned by domestication experiments, such
as the one carried out by geneticist Dimitri Belyaev. Belyaev has become
famous for selectively breeding tameness in foxes, animals that in close
captivity might break teeth or die from exhaustion attempting to escape
their cages, engage in stereotypies, and be incredibly fearful and
aggressive around humans. By starting out selectively breeding those
animals that fled last when approached, and later selecting for
friendliness to people, Belyaev achieved remarkably tame, handleable,
pro-social foxes in less than twenty generations. Interestingly, he also
obtained piebald coats, floppy ears, curly tails, shorter muzzles,
rounded skulls, and barking, which had not been selected
for.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Piebald coat color is a common theme in many domesticated species, but
does not occur in their wild counterparts. Belyaev has hypothesized that
production of L-dopa, a melanin (pigment) precursor, was delayed during
development, resulting in white patches on the animal's coat. L-dopa is
also an adrenalin precursor, so it's possible that there is lower
adrenalin in these animals, which then attenuates fight or flight
responses. Serotonin---low levels of which are implicated in anxiety,
fear, aggression, depression, and poor impulse control---was
significantly higher and corticosteroid levels (stress hormones) lower
in the selectively bred foxes. And, the fear period in their development
commenced weeks later than that of the wild controls. By breeding for a
different neurochemical profile (i.e., tame behavior), Belyaev may have
modified genes that control the turning on and off of other key genes
for behavior and morphology during the foxes' embryological and
post-natal development, such as those that resulted in the pedomorphic
(short muzzles, etc.) features.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[It's impossible to resist speculating about genetic predispositions to
neurochemistry that potentiates higher degrees of fear and aggression in
dogs. Even if selective breeding for super ease of socialization never
catches on in the dog fancy, this in no way condemns any dog to a
lifetime of fight or flight to innocuous stimuli. Our understanding of
serotonin modulation by way of everything from exercise, supplements,
and nutrition to ever smarter generations of medications increases
yearly and this knowledge has already begun to reach dog owners and
professionals. My hope is that one day, a sophisticated combination of
diligent breeding, mod, and meds will relegate these most serious of
behavior problems to history.]{.calibre7}

[One of the great---but annoying and confusing---things about science is
that all conclusions are tentative and as evidence is generated,
prevailing theories are morphed or dropped. A great example of this is
the hunt for domestic dog origins. It's been a bit of a jigsaw puzzle
because the puzzle pieces have come in gradually---research has
proceeded at a trickle rather than a flood. And, the puzzle pieces have
been made up of evidence from multiple sources: archeological evidence
(fossils, bones, artifacts, art), morphological evidence (comparing dog
anatomy and physiology to that of wolves), and genetic evidence. For a
time, it seemed these sources pointed to dif ferent answers, but newer
research is filling gaps and pointing to a possible convergence of
evidence into one theory.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[First of all, the easy part: dogs are descended from gray wolves, not
jackals and not coyotes. To understand some of the strongest evidence
for this statement, it's necessary to first understand mitochondrial
DNA. We're all familiar with the DNA contained in the nucleus of our
cells: it contains the recipes for building the proteins that determine
most of our genetic traits such as having two legs, two arms, five
fingers, straight hair, and a pre-disposition to like asparagus. We each
inherit half of our complement of nuclear DNA from each of our
parents.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[There is another kind of DNA housed in mitochondria, structures that
are in our cells, but outside the nucleus. They are mainly involved in
energy production for the cell. The reason mitochondria have their own
DNA is that they are likely the descendents of nucleus-free cellular
organisms that fused with the ancestors of our nucleus-containing cells
to make the cells that now make up most of our bodies. Teaming up as a
cell within a cell was a win-win situation (symbiosis) for both parties,
evolutionarily speaking. Mitochondrial DNA comes in shorter strands than
nuclear DNA and is inherited only in the maternal line (everyone, both
male and female, gets theirs from their mothers---sperm have
insufficient luggage space). It is important because some of it is
expressed in our bodies (e.g., cytochrome b mutations that result in
decreased exercise tolerance), and also because it has a slow mutation
rate, which allows relatively accurate relatedness comparisons across
large numbers of generations.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Mitochondrial DNA sequencing has eliminated all discussion about the
relationship between dogs, wolves, and coyotes. For example, wolves
differ from dogs by less than 0.2% in their mitochondrial DNA whereas
they differ from coyotes by approximately 4%. Dogs and wolves are
incredibly closely related. In fact, they are literally one species,
dogs being a sub-species or variety of wolf. (The definition of a
"species" is that all members can inter-breed and produce fertile
offspring.)]{.calibre7}

[As for the origins of domestication, the earliest archeological find
believed to be a dog dates from 14,000 years ago: a jawbone found in
Germany. Smallish dog bones found in the Middle East have been dated at
12,000 years ago. Other archeological finds from this time are more
ambiguous: possibly dogs, but also possibly smallish wolves. In Utah,
clear evidence of dogs has been dated at approximately 9,000 to 10,000
years ago. This and existing mitochondrial DNA evidence from the mid
1990s initially suggested multiple domestication events in the old and
new world. This means that the theory, until very recently, was that
different sub-populations of wolf were independently domesticated to
produce different ancestral strains accounting for clusters of modern
dog breeds.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre17
[Then, in 1997, a bombshell paper: mitochondrial DNA evidence collected
from a large sample of dogs and wolves prompted the authors to propose a
split-off of dogs from wolves over 100,000 years ago. This is an order
of magnitude away from the archeological evidence. To explain the
discrepancy, it was hypothesized that although this genetic split had
taken place, there was insufficient change in body type---especially
those hard structures that fossilize more readily---to create any
evidence of the split in the fossil record. The 100,000 years ago
domestication bombshell later fizzled out due to lack of corroborating
evidence. There was more than one way to interpret those results, one of
which supported the more recent domestication.]{.calibre7}

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[In 2002, two teams of researchers published research converging back on
a single domestication event on the order of 15,000 years ago. One team
focused on the locale of early domestication, concluding that East Asia
is where wolves were first turned into dogs. There were five definite
lines, each derived from a single female wolf, with hints of a possible
sixth line, all based on extensive mitochondrial DNA analysis. This
suggests that dogs caught on like wildfire, spreading to all corners of
the globe with human migration.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5

:::

::: calibre17
[The other team also provided strong refutation of the multiple
domestication events hypothesis by comparing mitochondrial DNA from late
Pleistocene dogs from the Old and New Worlds with that of modern dogs.

split off from them about 15,000 years ago.]{.calibre7}

[While a formidable tool for researchers into domestication, the slow
mutation rate of mitochondrial DNA turns out to be a disadvantage for
elucidating the genetic relatedness of modern dog breeds as these have
existed for just a few hundred years in the vast majority of cases. So,
nuclear DNA evidence was used by researchers who in 2004 published
findings that compare the genetics of eighty-five breeds of dog as well
as the order of their splitting off from wolves.]{.calibre7}

[The earliest split-off from wolves was a branch consisting of Shar
Peis, Shiba Inus, Chows and Akitas. Next came Basenjis. The third branch
was made up of Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies (which,
incidentally, were difficult to distinguish genetically). The fourth
group to split off were Afghans and Salukis. Then came a giant group
with the most modern origins, consisting of all the other breeds that
were analyzed. Interestingly, Pharaoh and Ibizan Hounds, considered
extremely old breeds, were in the modern-origins group genetically. What
this means is that modern Pharaoh and Ibizan Hounds are re-creations of
the dogs drawn on interior walls in ancient Egypt.]{.calibre7}

At the far right is complete friendliness with new people. At the other
end is complete distrust and spookiness with new people. The phenotypes
of all dogs could be placed along this continuum at a specific point
that represents how sociable they are with unfamiliar people. This
phenotype---the actual behavior we can see and measure in the real

latter. It's a notion out of 1960's television. The problem is dogs
don't have radar for good people and bad people. For every dog that
makes headlines as a hero for nailing a would-be burglar or attacker are
likely hundreds of other dogs who bit the gardener, visitor, or
approaching child for exactly the same reasons: being not fully
comfortable about strangers.]{.calibre7}

[Any coveting of low ease of socialization in dogs that are expected to
be someone's pet is a virtual make-work program for trainers and
behaviorists who counsel on fear and aggression to strangers cases. Too
often not only did the owner do all the right things vis-a-vis early
environment, socialization, and training, they threw every available
resource at healing the dog, who has collided with a low genetic
ceiling. In some cases prospective buyers didn't read through the
euphemisms when they did their breed homework and then were not provided
with frank "package warnings" from their breeder. In other cases, the
owners thought that's what they wanted or thought they could compensate
(or were told they could compensate) with diligent early intervention.
It is not only heart-breaking for these individual families but, in the
current BSL-crazy climate, a bad advertisement for dogs in
general.]{.calibre7}

[Yes, and with a coordinating interior color! I bet, too, that many of
those holding this book have dog vehicles, put dog-friendliness and
practicality high on the list when purchasing or renting housing, expend
some serious time each day to dog care and dog activities, frown over

[Dogs Moms buying SUV's for dogs is, to me, one of the most interesting
topics in all of behavior, encompassing love, sex, the struggle for
survival and, of course, the human-animal bond. Let's begin at the
beginning. Everything we are and everything we do---our behavior---has
one ultimate aim, which is the transportation of genetic information
through time. Every living organism alive is the culmination of an
unbroken string of successful reproducers. We see, think, cooperate,
wage war, and enjoy cheesecake all because teams of genes that produced
these traits out-reproduced teams of genes that did not in our
evolutionary history.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Evolution is governed by two forces, natural selection and sexual
selection. Natural selection refers to differential survival under the
environmental pressures that face living things: getting enough food,
not becoming injured or ill, avoiding becoming food, coping with climate
ups and downs, basically surviving long enough to reproduce. Sexual
selection is a different pressure. Survival is great, but what if you
don't breed? All those good genes that helped you survive don't get
passed on. So, you also have to win at the mating game. To do this,
another suite of characteristics may be needed.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Mates---and we're usually talking females, who build larger sex cells,
then endure pregnancy and nursing, and so have the bigger
investment---would like to combine their genes with the best quality
genes out there. So how does a girl know? The answer is warfare and
advertising. Males must out-compete other males on a variety of
battlefields, which can result in arms races of body size and weaponry,
and they dazzle females with outlandishly expensive displays, plumage,
gifts, nests, and the like, all saying, in effect, "I am so incredibly
fit and can so easily throw off parasites and all that so I can afford
to prance/grow/build this outraaaaageous thing. I will give you babies
that are stupendous and attractive like me."]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Here's the most interesting part. Although I use the image of some male
surviving, fighting, and advertising in order to reproduce, the unit
"trying" to get passed on is not the organism himself (or herself). The
units of natural and sexual selection are the individual genes in that
organism. The organism is a vehicle that teams of genes build to
transport themselves through time. There are genes that code for basic
proteins common to all life that have achieved immortality over
literally billions of years. That's success.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[The idea of genes as the units of selection represented a paradigm
shift in biology away from "group selection," the notion that animals
behave for the "good of the group." And, when biologists say that genes
are "selfish," it simply means they don't care whether the organism
lives or dies a Braveheart death, as long as they make it to the next
generation. As it happens, a good many traits that are in the genes'
interest are in the interests of the organism. There is some use of
metaphor here. Genes aren't trying to do anything. They don't sit around
thinking about their "interests." The ones that happen to team up with
other genes and produce traits that happen to enhance the survival and
reproduction of their vehicles proliferate. Actually, plenty of crafty,
but naughty, genes hitch rides through the generations not by enhancing
survival and reproduction of their vehicles; so-called "junk DNA" codes
for nothing except "copy me."]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[When it came along, selfish gene theory tied the fields of evolutionary
biology and genetics together beautifully, but there was a snag. The
snag was altruistic behavior. Why on earth would selfish genes code for
their vehicle to make any kind of sacrifice? Enter W.D. Hamilton. In the
early 1960's, Hamilton came up with mathematical formulas to support the
idea of inclusive fitness, i.e., kin selection. His theories allowed
testable predictions, which were born out. Genes don't care about which
vehicle they move through time in, so altruistic behavior between
animals that share genes is in proportion to their genetic
relatedness.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre5
 \
:::

::: calibre17
[Which brings us to the strong bond between parent and offspring. There
is little that is more in the interest of genes than coding for traits
that help them move successfully down generations, i.e., competent
parenting. Genes that coded for Deadbeat Parents were out-reproduced by
The Nurturers. The mechanism for recognizing kin and then directing
altruistic behavior at them is not some artful measuring of degree of
relatedness. It is very likely mediated neurochemically and hormonally
(in humans at least---insects very often use scent).]{.calibre7}

[So, it could be that when Dog Moms nurture and spend time with their
dogs, they experience the same suite of brain chemicals---some
combination of oxytocin, vasopressin, dopamine, serotonin, and
norepinephrine---that mothers experience when nurturing their babies. If
this is so, a Dog Mom's body can't compute the societal chant of "it's
just a dog" because it is responding via machinery that evolved to
respond to offspring. You may know (or may yourself be) someone who
responds more strongly to puppies than to babies. Directing parenting
resources at puppies is a colossal misfire, from your genes' point of
view. They are at a dead end if a Dog Mom doesn't have any human
children.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre17
[Which begs the question: how are Dog Moms made? What causes
neurochemistry that makes dogs the target of parenting behavior?
Exclusive (i.e., dogs instead of, rather than in addition to, children)
Dog Moms clearly come from non-Exclusive Dog Mom families. There are Dog
Moms in each generation. Is the potential in all of us and only gets
switched on in certain individuals? If so, how? Is it a mutation that
just keeps popping up at a certain low frequency in the human population
regardless of its tendency to lower the fitness of its bearer? I'll be
pondering all this in the car on my way to the dog birthday party
tomorrow.]{.calibre7}
