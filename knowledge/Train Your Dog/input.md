There are many people who have helped and inspired me to write this
book. First among these is my husband, Van, who is such a remarkable man
in every way: he has kept me sane through all the filming and traveling,
and his editing has been instrumental in helping me to shape this book
into what it is. He works tirelessly alongside me to spread the word
about humane training and is dedicated to *positively* affecting the
lives of dogs around the world. I also thank my beloved family on both
sides of the pond for all their love and support, my dear friends who
are always there for me, and my wonderful editor for this book, Lisa
Westmoreland.

In my work as a dog trainer and author, I have been inspired by some of
the greatest minds behind the science of modern dog training, including
the incredible Dr. Patricia McConnell, Dr. Karen Pryor, Dr. Nicholas
Dodman, Dr. Ian Dunbar, James O'Heare, Jean Donaldson, Dr. Stanley
Coren, Suzanne Clothier, Pat Miller, Nicole Wilde, and more. Thank you
to all those who have helped forge a path forward against sometimes
stiff headwinds on behalf of the movement toward positive training.

Thanks also to my tremendous team of Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog
Training (VSPDT) trainers. I am very proud to be
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_ack_r1.htm#pageviii}affiliated with each of
you and continue to be amazed and inspired by your passion, dedication,
and drive to ensure that everyone has access to people who truly
understand dogs and work hard to combat the damage that has been done by
punitive training methods. Our shared goal of making the world a better
place for dogs and their people is within reach!

To my father, Malcolm Stilwell, thank you for working so hard to give me
the best start in life, and to my grandmother, Estelle Hepworth, for
fostering my love of dogs. To Garry Gross, my former dog training
partner in Manhattan, I loved sharing the journey with you. I miss you
all so much.

And finally, I thank my daughter, Alexandra, who makes me a better
person every day. Her goodness, kindness, compassion, sense of justice,
and love for life, people, and animals is a constant inspiration and a
joy to behold. I have been blessed with many fantastic opportunities and
achievements in my career, but the production I am most proud of and
honored to consider a success comes from being a wife and
mother---raising a child who makes the world an infinitely better place.
I am the proudest mother in the world, and I love you, Alex, with all my
heart.

"Positive reinforcement works great on easy dogs, but it's not really
effective on severe aggression cases, is it?"

As one of the world's most vocal proponents of force-free dog training
methods, I get asked this type of question frequently, usually by people
who are pretty sure they already know the answer. Over the past several
decades, science and history have taught us so much about how dogs
think, feel, and learn, yet some dog trainers and owners still believe
the only way to communicate effectively with a difficult dog is to
"teach it who's boss" and force it into some mythical state called "calm
submission." The issues arising from this common and fundamental
misunderstanding of our canine companions are what motivate me every day
to continue my work as a dog behavior consultant and educator.

There are many different terms used to describe the type of teaching
methods I use: *positive reinforcement, reward-based, force-free*, and
more. Proponents of these interrelated philosophies have a shared belief
that it is much safer, more effective, and humane to teach animals using
this overarching concept: If you reward a behavior you like, it is more
likely that that behavior will be
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_itr_r1.htm#page2}repeated. Similarly, if you
ignore or redirect a behavior you don't like, it is more likely that
incidences of that behavior will decrease.

That's a very simplistic synopsis of what reward-based training is and
how it works, but that general concept lays the foundation for
everything a dog owner needs to know to build a healthy relationship
with any dog. Combine this concept with an awareness that dogs are not
wolves trying to dominate us, so do not need to be controlled using
dominance-based punishment techniques, and you have the recipe for what
I call *positive training* throughout this
book.[\*](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_itr_r1.htm#itr-ftn1){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_itr_r1.htm#itr-ftn1a
.hlink}

Unfortunately (but predictably), those who still promote punitive,
outdated traditional training methods aren't going quietly. There is a
fierce debate raging in the dog training world between these two camps,
and as a result, positive trainers regularly hear the same old tired
arguments and accusations:

::: hanging01
    • There's more than one way to train a dog.

    • Reward-based training methods don't work on severe behavior
problems such as aggression.

    • Dogs only "respect" leaders who assert their "dominance."

    • Force-free trainers don't use discipline.

    • Training a dog with food is tantamount to bribery.

    • If you train a dog using food, he or she will respond only when
you're holding treats.

    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_itr_r1.htm#page3}Dogs that misbehave
or show aggression are trying to be dominant.

    • Dogs are pack animals like wolves and are hell-bent on becoming
the "alpha" or "top dog" over their owners.
:::

Every one of these statements is almost completely backward, and I'll
get to each one of them (and more) in detail in the course of this book.
For now, I can say that there are many, many ways to effectively and
humanely teach your dog---provided that you start from the basis of
positive reinforcement principles rather than outdated and misguided
theories of dog behavior.

There is a great deal of publicly available misinformation about how to
build "balanced" relationships with our dogs based on
"submission"---information that is purportedly the key to making our
lives and relationships with our dogs better. If we could ask our dogs,
I have no doubt they would let us know emphatically that such concepts
as forced "balance" and supposedly contented "submission" are a pretty
far cry from what they're actually feeling most of the time.

And that's one of the biggest problems in the dog training world today:
those who promote what I call dominance, punitive, or compulsion
training are realizing that the dog-owning public is figuring out that
there must be a better, more effective and humane way to teach their
dogs. As a result, these trainers have adapted and borrowed some of the
science-based community's language, repackaged it, and are now selling
it as their own marketing buzzwords: *Positive reinforcement.
Reward-based. Gentle*. But no matter what they try to call it,
traditional dominance and punishment trainers are using methods that are
the exact opposite of the misappropriated labels they're using to sell
their services.

There is a subset of hybrid trainers who actually do use positive
reinforcement when teaching basic learning and language-building
exercises but who either remain unconvinced that this
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_itr_r1.htm#page4}training method will be
effective or lack the confidence and skills to harness its power for
more serious behavior problems. These trainers also employ punishment
when dealing with "tougher" cases, even though these are the very dogs
that would benefit the most from positive training and are most likely
to regress further when punished or forced into so-called submissive
states.

In truth, anyone can successfully employ positive reinforcement when
teaching basic obedience and dealing with "easy" dogs, but it takes
advanced knowledge, confidence, and strong leadership skills to
successfully employ positive training on the most difficult behavioral
cases. *What sets good positive trainers apart from punitive trainers is
not just their ability to teach a dog to do* something *using force-free
methods, but also how they manage to* stop *unwanted behaviors while
still using humane training techniques instead of punishment*.

The landscape of the dog training world is now so confusing that owners
who want a positive trainer have trouble figuring out exactly who fits
that description. Compulsion trainers have seen their once-impregnable
market shares start to shrink as trainers who follow modern behavioral
science have begun to eat into their profits. TV shows like *It's Me or
the Dog* and other media have made the public aware that there is indeed
a better way to teach*---positively*. I've talked to people who told me
they just didn't feel right using force and intimidation on their
beloved canine companions, but the trainers they hired reassured them
that they were using positive reinforcement. I can't blame people for
falling for this clever marketing ploy---I've worked with dogs for a
very long time, and sometimes even *I* still can't tell when someone
actually believes what I believe or just knows enough buzzwords to
squeak by.

This confusion and the difficulty people have trying to teach their dog
humanely or to find a force-free trainer were the inspiration behind
this book and the creation of Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog Training
(VSPDT)---a global network of world-class
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_itr_r1.htm#page5}professional positive
reinforcement dog trainers united in their passion for promoting
positive training in place of punishment and dominance. All VSPDT
trainers have been individually assessed by me and verified to be
practitioners of science-based, force-free methods. (For more
information on sourcing a trainer, see the [Resources
section](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_res_r1.htm){.hlink}.)

As someone who is often referred to as a torchbearer of humane teaching
methodologies, I struggle to understand how anyone can justify teaching
a dog through the use of force and fear. While learning to become a dog
trainer, I was taught all kinds of techniques that I've long since
abandoned, and even though I never physically punished a dog, I found
that even using aversives such as loud noises to interrupt or curb
negative behavior just never *felt* right. The more I investigated the
history and development of the science of dog behavior, the more certain
I became that my instinctual doubts were justified and well-founded.

My love for and fascination with dogs has developed into a passion for
making sure that people know there is a more effective, humane,
rewarding, and enduring way to teach their dogs. This book will respond
to many of the arguments you may hear from skeptics of positive
training. It is designed to provide positive, humane solutions to some
common (and often hard to live with) behaviors. Along the way, I'll also
provide the scientific and anecdotal evidence to support why the
scientific community and I can unequivocally state that trying to
dominate a dog into what traditional trainers call "submission" through
the use of force, punishment, and intimidation is inhumane, damaging,
and ultimately less effective than science-based positive training.

The choice before any dog owner is a simple one: do you want your dog to
follow you because she wants to or because she's scared of what will
happen to her if she doesn't? To me, the answer is obvious.

::: footnote
[\*](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_itr_r1.htm#itr-ftn1a){.hlink} Note that
use of the word *positive* in this case does not reflect the strict
scientific description of the word as defined among the four quadrants
of operant conditioning. For example, *positive punishment* is the
addition of punishment during training, and I obviously do not condone
or include such methods in my definition of the term *positive training*
as I use it for the purposes of this book. Throughout this book, I refer
to myself and others like me as *positive trainers*, and in doing so, I
am referring to the same combination of reward-based training methods
and non--dominance/punishment/alpha hierarchy awareness, not the
scientific definition of the word.

# DOMINANCE AND PACK THEORY  [Are Dogs on a Quest for World Domination?]{.small1} {.subchapter}

Has anyone ever told you that if your dog goes through an open door
ahead of you, it's a sign that he's asserting his dominance? Or if a dog
walks in front of you or pulls on a leash, he is doing so because he
wants to be pack leader? What about if he lies on a sofa, sleeps in your
bed, or growls at you as you take his bone away? Are these really all
signs of an intense struggle between man and dog over status in the
household? Is everything a dog thinks, feels, and does the result of an
unmitigated desire to dominate us, and everything else, in his quest to
become top dog?

Concepts like these have been pounded into our public consciousness for
decades, leading people to believe that any type of misbehavior by their
dogs is a byproduct of an innate, instinctive desire to be dominant over
everything and everyone---especially humans. This assumption forms the
foundation of traditional dog training ideology, despite advances in
modern behavioral science
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page10}that I'll discuss later in
the chapter. Indeed, much of the information still available to the
general public promotes and endorses solutions to a dominance problem
that doesn't really exist---at least not in the way some think it does.

Of course, that's not to say that there are no canine behavior problems
to solve. My ever-growing workload as a dog trainer and behavior
consultant attests to there being more problems than ever. What's more,
they exist in large part precisely *because* this fundamental
misunderstanding of dominance has been applied so broadly in our
relationships with our dogs.

Most of the dog-owning public has long been misled into thinking that
treating dominance is the key to solving most dog behavior problems,
when the reality is quite different. Terms such as *alpha dog, top dog*,
and *pack leader* have become part of our society's readily accepted and
commonly understood lexicon. When these terms are used to describe
*human* concepts of leadership and rank hierarchy, they can indeed be
useful. But when we ascribe these concepts to our domesticated dogs, we
are assuming, incorrectly, that dogs place the same value that we do on
the practice of identifying who is of higher rank. Unfortunately,
misunderstanding the source of a dog's behavior often results in
unbalanced, unconfident, and ultimately unhappy dogs (and owners).

Think of dog training in medical terms. If you don't know what the root
cause of a given problem is, you can't effectively treat it. Diagnosis
and treatment can become skewed when too much emphasis is placed on
symptoms rather than an investigation into root causes. And if you
misdiagnose the disease, you usually end up applying the wrong
treatment. In a best-case scenario, you've delayed the patient's
recovery and will quickly realize the treatment isn't working, admit
your mistake, and apply the correct remedy. In the worst case, an
inappropriate treatment plan based on the misdiagnosis actually
exacerbates the patient's
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page11}condition, making it more
difficult to solve, if and when you realize your mistake.

Unfortunately for dogs, a dominance-related misdiagnosis of their
behavior problems usually leads to the worst-case scenario:
traditionally prescribed behavior-modification techniques usually
include punishment, intimidation, and fear---precisely the opposite of
what dogs really need to overcome most behavioral issues.

If the result of this unfortunate process was merely unhappy,
unfulfilled dogs, it would be incredibly sad but not an epic tragedy.
But the problem is larger than that. The massive growth in dog ownership
numbers, combined with this epidemic of punishment-based dog training,
has created a population of dogs and dog owners who have never been more
challenged to communicate effectively and safely. An increase in
owner-surrendered pets at rescue shelters due to behavior problems has
led to steadily increasing euthanasia rates. The number of dog bites and
attacks, especially on children, are increasing despite local
governments' attempts to approach the problem (from the wrong end of the
leash) by using breed-specific legislation.

To find a more appropriate and hopeful solution, we need to appreciate
how people came to so misunderstand and misdiagnose how our dogs think,
feel, and learn. Then we will explore what modern behavioral science
tells us is truly at play. We need to know how we got here and what
needs to be changed so that we can more effectively, safely, and
humanely build relationships with our dogs.

## What Is Dominance? {.section}

To understand how the word *dominance* became so prevalent in describing
dog-to-dog and human-to-dog social relationships, we have to look back
at early studies of animal behavior. The term
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page12}*pecking order* was
originally used to explain the social hierarchies of domestic fowl in
the
1920s.[^1^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c01-nts1){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts1a
.hlink} Researchers observed that chickens commonly established what was
assumed to be social rank by pecking at or threatening to peck each
other. Since then, studies on social hierarchies have been done on many
other species, and the evidence compiled from them has gradually helped
us understand how animals form relationships and survive in social
groups. Researchers conducting these later studies found that although
dominant members of certain animal groups were more likely than others
to display threatening or aggressive behavior if required, they would
more often assert their influence (dominance) *without the use of
force*. Other more submissive members of the animal group maintained the
status quo by *offering* deference and appeasement behaviors to the more
dominant
members.[^2^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c01-nts2){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts2a
.hlink} *In other words, dominance is not so much a character trait as
it is a term that describes the relationship between animals, a
relationship that is usually exerted without the use of force, thereby
reducing the potential for conflict and ensuring safety and survival*.

This is a critical part of understanding how dogs interact. If a
particular dog is dominant over another, such status is usually freely
acknowledged and mutually understood---most often without issue.
Misunderstanding the word and the role dominance plays in our dogs'
lives has caused untold amounts of confusion. So I prefer to use the
term *controlling behavior* when working with clients because it more
accurately describes the domestic dog's social intentions.

## Who's the Boss? {.section}

Traditional training theorists have led people to believe that social
hierarchies among multidog households and human/dog families are
*fixed*, with an "alpha" (dog or person) at the top of the hierarchy
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page13}and other members of the
human or canine family fitting nicely into slots underneath. Although
social hierarchies do exist among dogs and certain dogs are more
controlling than others, studies have shown that such dynamics are
constantly
changing.[^3^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c01-nts3){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts3a
.hlink} Dogs that live in multidog households, for example, are usually
able to work out among themselves who has primary access to what,
depending on the value each dog places on a resource. For example, some
dogs might place more value on a food resource when it comes to feeding
time, whereas others may desire first choice for a preferred sleeping
location. One dog usually does not control access to every single
resource but will control those he deems to be of highest value to him.
To maintain a safe and peaceful environment, a dog must be able to
accept another dog's prior claim to certain resources.

Of course, as can be the case with humans, flare-ups of tension occur
when dogs disagree over who has primary access to a certain resource.
When two dogs place equal value on something (such as a bone, food bowl,
toy, bed, potential mate, or even a human), they might fight because
they are in direct competition over that resource, *not* because they
are concerned about elevating their personal status within the
hierarchy!

Although disagreements occur among dogs that have healthy relationships
with each other, some dogs display socially inappropriate behavior,
disrupting the status quo by bullying others. As with bullies generally,
these dogs are usually quite the opposite of confident and self-assured.

Let's think about it in human terms for a moment. Is the common school
bully the most confident kid in the class or the most insecure?
Invariably, bullies are not confident people, and their need to control
others by inflicting physical or emotional harm is driven by an acute
insecurity rather than an abundance of healthy self-confidence. Canine
bullies are also insecure, and
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page14}although they may
influence the behavior of other dogs, this is *still* not the result of
a battle for rank. Macho, bullying behavior has no place in a natural,
well-functioning dominant/submissive canine relationship or a
human/canine relationship. Often, dogs that bully can best be described
as having an acute case of bad manners or an unpleasant
personality---just like humans. In the end, the sad fact is that there
are some dogs that are, quite simply, jerks (although we still love
them!).

We humans still find it very difficult to resist the idea that dogs
share our interest in dominance and rank. Because we are capable of
rational thought and intricate extrapolation of consequences, we may
quest for ever-higher rank for many reasons: ego, desperation, revenge,
boredom, insecurity, and ambition. Gaining high status demonstrates
success in society and allows a person to have more control over others,
earn a higher wage, and ensure future success. In contrast, dogs'
perception of status is far less complex and emotional: if a dog values
a certain resource or is more intent on achieving reproductive success
than others are, he will notify those others that he is planning on
protecting or controlling access to these things that make him feel good
and ensure his safety and survival.

The great sadness in misunderstanding how dominance and submission work
in healthy canine social relationships is that it has led to the use of
training techniques designed to *force* a dog into a "submissive state."
Those who employ forceful methods believe they are displaying leadership
just like a "dominant" dog would do to establish rank; in reality they
are behaving like socially inappropriate bullies. This in turn
compromises a dog's ability to learn, and it significantly damages the
bond between them.

So, to summarize, if "dominance" in the animal world means that force or
violence is seldom used to maintain a functional status quo, why do some
trainers and dog owners still believe that
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page15}using forceful and
punitive techniques to make their dogs submissive and establish
themselves as the "pack leader" is the best way to teach them? They do
so because the human concept of dominance (based on accumulating power,
establishing higher rank, and exerting control in a forceful and
sometimes violent way) muddles their understanding of canine
relationships and social hierarchies and so dictates how they attempt to
manage them.

## Dogs Versus Wolves {.section}

So where did we go so wrong?

Dominance and pack theory in the dog world is based in large part on
research collected from studies performed on a pack of unrelated,
captive wolves in the 1970s. The results of these studies suggested that
there was a *fixed* hierarchy in which "alphas" (leaders) had priority
access to resources, *forcefully* maintaining the group structure
through displays of aggression to
others.[^4^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c01-nts4){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts4a
.hlink}

Because dogs were descended from wolves, it was assumed that similar
pack dynamics must exist among domestic dogs and that desire, drive, and
competitive success would push "top dogs" to the top of the hierarachy.
This theory became so popular that despite the obvious---that dogs and
wolves are separated by thousands of years of evolution and that dogs
and humans are completely different species---the theory was used to
explain not only the social interactions between dogs but also how
people should train them.

These captive-wolf studies have since been renounced by the very
scientists who performed them and reached their original conclusions. It
turns out that captive wolves with no choice but to live in unrelated
groups (not their own blood-related families) behave very differently
from members of what we now know to be a true natural wolf pack. Dr.
David Mech, the wolf expert and senior scientist with the U.S.
Geological Survey who was largely
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page16}responsible for the
original scientific study promoting "pack theory" (much of which he
himself has since debunked), now explains that the behavioral
differences between captive wolves like those used in his study and
wolves in the wild are pronounced enough to call the results of his
original research into question. According to modern behavioral science,
any random group of undomesticated species artificially placed together
will naturally compete with one
another.[^5^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c01-nts5){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts5a
.hlink} Scientific research has since concluded that in the wild, a true
natural pack is actually composed of a mother and father and their
offspring. This pack survives rather like a human family in which the
parents take the leadership roles and the children follow. In a natural
pack, harmony is created because, as we now know, deference behaviors
are offered freely by the younger wolves rather than being forced onto
them by their parents. This deference avoids injury that would
compromise the pack's ability to hunt prey successfully.

The study's results were also skewed by the observation of subjects
under severe stress because they were captives, forced to live with
unrelated wolves in an unnatural environment, unable to behave as they
would in a natural familial pack. These non-familial wolves had no
choice but to interact with each other and develop coping mechanisms
that caused them to become far more competitive and aggressive. And
instead of focusing on the wolves' point of view, the researchers once
again used their own *human interpretations* to conclude that the wolves
were constantly driven by a desire to seek status over one another.
Trouble is, no one really questioned at that point whether wolves really
understood or shared our *human* concept of seeking status as a "rank
reduction" process. It is more likely that for these captive wolves, the
issue of rank was actually driven by something far simpler: the need for
safety, survival, and reproductive success. Acquiring a resource safely
would ensure survival, so although some wolves
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page17}figured out how to hold
onto their resources by challenging others and defending themselves,
other wolves learned to ensure their survival by showing deference.

In short, Mech's researchers were observing a dysfunctional group of
wolves using threat and deference displays to seek safety and survive
within their unnatural captive group.

Unfortunately, the true nature of dominance, submission, and rank
hierarchy has only recently been accurately understood. Because the
results of those early behavioral studies were misinterpreted and
misunderstood, dog trainers assumed that violent captive wolf behavior
could be neatly transferred into a box labeled "dog behavior."

## DOGS IN WOLVES' CLOTHING? {.section0}

Even though dogs and wolves are genetically similar, they are separated
by at least fifteen thousand years of domestication and that has changed
them in many important ways. Today's domestic dog is approximately as
genetically similar to the wolf as we humans are to chimpanzees. When
you consider the evolutionary and behavioral chasm between chimps and
ourselves, it becomes clear that although wolves and dogs share certain
physiological and behavioral traits, they are far more different from
each other than traditional pack theorists would have you believe. For
example, dogs are one of the few types of animals who are willing and
able to develop interspecies relationships. We take for granted how
amazing dogs are, given their ability not only to tolerate but sometimes
even befriend our pet cats, for example, while also developing close
relationships with us humans. Not many animals (certainly not wolves)
are able to bond with even one other species, let alone two or more.

Dogs are not socialized wolves. Not only has domestication set them
apart physiologically, but it has greatly influenced their
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page18}emotional development as
well. The difference in developmental stages between wolves and dogs in
early life is acute enough to affect their ability to form social
relationships throughout their lives. For example, at just fourteen days
old, wolf pups are able to walk around, eagerly investigating their
environment, whereas canine puppies are still wobbly on their legs.
Recent studies reveal that between the ages of four to eight weeks,
canine puppies can successfully form interspecies social attachments in
just ninety
minutes.[^6^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c01-nts6){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts6a
.hlink} Conversely, wolf pups could make the same social attachments
only after twenty-four hours of constant contact with another species,
and then only if all of the contact occurred before the pup was four
weeks old. Although dogs generalize their social relationships to humans
and are good at adapting to changing situations, wolves are very
specific about their social attachments and do not adapt well to
novelty, even when raised in captivity with or near humans. Interesting
studies at the Department of Ethology at Eötvös Loránd University in
Budapest demonstrated how aware canine puppies were to human body
movement compared to wolf pups raised in the same domestic
environment.[^7^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c01-nts7){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts7a
.hlink} The puppies in this study showed an almost instinctive ability
to follow the direction of a human point, whereas the wolf pups were
disinterested and unable to make eye contact. The puppies naturally
cooperated with the researchers and were much better at learning by
observing and taking direction from them, whereas the domesticated
wolves never looked to their human caregivers for guidance and behaved
more as they would have in the wild, despite their domestication.

So if the captive wolf model led us down the wrong path, what model
should we use to help us understand the dynamics of a modern dog pack?
Observing feral dogs gives us a much more accurate picture of the
domestic dog's social structure than either wild or captive wolf packs.
It's more likely that modern domestic dogs are
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page19}descended from solitary
feral dogs that scavenged human garbage for food than from true familial
packs. Although scavengers need a group for protection, they don't need
a team to track and bring down prey and are usually more successful
finding food when operating by themselves. In fact, having too many
other dogs around means there is more competition for that food,
resulting in a much looser social structure that changes with
environment and situation---namely, with the abundance (or lack) of
food. But thousands of years of separation from the wolf have also
altered the social behavior of feral dogs: they don't stay in fixed
family packs, and while the only wolves that mate in a pack are the
breeding pair, mating is unrestricted in the feral dog population---it
can occur among dogs within a family group or between dogs of different
groups.

In conclusion, although their similar appearance and genetic proximity
to one another make it tempting to assume that dogs and wolves behave
the same way, they are dissimilar enough to warrant separate studies of
their behavioral tendencies. When we don't understand these differences
and misapply behavioral understandings from one to another, it can lead
to gross misconceptions. Indeed, the most important distinction between
dogs and wolves is that, while they are both animals with a primary
natural instinct to be safe and survive, dogs and wolves learn in very
different ways and place very different premiums on the value of
interaction with other species.

## Be the Pack Leader---Really? {.section}

Dogs are not wolves and they're not humans either. But it's a common
refrain that is heard frequently among people in the dog world today:
"Be the pack leader." Even people who aren't specifically talking about
dogs or our relationships with them use this
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page20}catchphrase regularly, and
it has become a mainstay of human self-help and managerial doctrine.
While it has value in a human-only scenario, it is dramatically
misunderstood when applied to a dog's world.

As a species, humans are the most advanced, thoughtful, sentient beings
in our planet's history. Not only do we feel emotions such as joy,
jealousy, temptation, fear, and love, but we can also draw correlations
between these emotions and the effect they have on our actions while
also appreciating the impact our actions and words have on others. This
is one of the most fundamental differences between humans and other
beings (like dogs) that feel emotion---we care about what other people
think of us. As far as we are aware, dogs don't have that ability. More
precisely, the extent to which they care about what others think of them
is limited to self-interest and well-being. For example, we may
translate the joy our dogs display upon our return from a day at work as
a signal of how much they love us and have hated the time they've spent
apart from us (based on a long history of bonding and an unwavering
expectation that they wouldn't be abandoned), but the dog may actually
be feeling ecstatic elation that her provider of all good things
(affection, food, companionship, and protection) has returned. It's not
that dogs are selfish but they are egocentric.

Our ability to extrapolate, correlate, and sympathize has served us well
as a species, but it has also created several unfortunate side effects
that we sometimes have a hard time realizing are not shared by those
around us---including dogs. We assume that because we suffer from
varying degrees of overconfidence, and tend to be seduced by the
accumulation of rank and power, dogs must do the same. Even dominance
trainers often stress that you should never anthropomorphize (ascribe
human characteristics to) your dog. I completely agree that we should
resist the urge to
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page21}"humanize" our dogs too
much (while still recognizing that we share certain similarities). The
irony is that to believe dogs see us as their pack leaders actually
*requires* that we first anthropomorphize dogs by assuming they share
our human concern regarding rank and what others think of us.

For example, my little Chihuahua-Terrier mix, Jasmine, doesn't care what
my chocolate Labrador, Sadie, thinks of her when she slinks in to steal
an antler that Sadie had been chewing. She's not worried about hurting
Sadie's feelings. She just places a higher value on the antler at that
moment and makes decisions that give her the best chance of getting it.

When we see our human intentions, motives, and responses in our dogs'
behavior, we're effectively making things up as we go along; our dogs
simply don't approach things the same way we do. Indeed, Jasmine may
feel "envious" of Sadie for having the antler, but we must resist the
urge to assume that Jasmine or Sadie really cares what the other thinks
of her beyond how it will immediately affect her own individual
well-being.

So because we now understand that dogs aren't in an ego-driven race to
become the leader of the free world (or even just their own household),
it follows that they also have no reason to suspect that that is our
personal goal as well. Sure, they know that we are the ones who control
access to food, water, and other things that allow them to survive and
make them feel good, but we are also the ones who stop them from doing
what they might otherwise naturally think is perfectly acceptable
(chewing the sofa and peeing on the carpet come to mind). It is only
when we misinterpret canine behavior that we start to think dogs must be
trying to achieve a higher rank than us. And what's the highest possible
rank? Pack leader, of course.

So the entire concept that we must assert our claim to the throne of
pack leader before our dogs do is based on a mirage. For
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page22}the sake of argument,
though, let's say that dogs *are* completely motivated by a burning
desire to become pack leader over their human counterparts. At some
point in this theoretical exercise we must necessarily decide to
disregard the simple truth---that dogs are well aware that we are not,
in fact, dogs. Science gives us absolutely no reason to assume that
because dogs have been domesticated so successfully that they can
assimilate easily into our human world, they can somehow be fooled into
thinking that we are not really humans at all but are strange,
two-legged, hairless (for the most part) dogs. They know that we're not
dogs just as well as we know they're not human. For some reason, though,
dominance trainers like to emulate canine behavior by jabbing dogs with
their fingertips, for example, pretending to "nip" as a mother dog does
when she corrects her pups. These trainers believe that dogs make the
association between jabbing fingers and the reprimands they once
received from their canine mothers' mouths. I disagree. Dogs are much
smarter than that!

To put the final nail in the coffin of the pack leader concept, however,
we must return to this fact: true packs don't really exist in the
domestic dog world in the first place. Putting aside briefly that dogs
are not wolves and should not be treated as such, the definition of a
true pack is, again, a mother, father, and their offspring---a
combination usually found only in the wild (not in captivity). Very
occasionally in wolf packs, a lone unrelated wolf may be "adopted" by an
existing pack, but this is somewhat rare. Obviously, it is extremely
rare to find a blood-related family of dogs---mother, father, and their
offspring---living together as domestic pets in today's society.
Therefore we should move away from calling our usually unrelated dogs
living in one household a pack. I prefer to use the word *group* or
*household*.

I'm not suggesting that dogs can't live well with each other in groups.
Indeed, one of the primary benefits of their successful
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page23}domestication is their
adaptability and, arguably more important, their sociability. But
animals live in packs precisely to ensure their survival---they rely on
each other to help hunt and provide sustenance. Domestic dogs obviously
do not (and at this point in their domestication usually *cannot*) rely
on themselves to hunt, either individually or in groups---their survival
and well-being are almost completely dependent on their relationships
with us. So, although domestic dogs may not be pack animals, they *are*
incredibly social animals able to develop relationships among themselves
and several other species simultaneously, allowing them to live
perfectly comfortably either as an "only dog" or as part of a multidog
household.

It is time, therefore, to finally retire the term *pack
leader*---especially when it refers to humans interacting with dogs.
Domestic dogs don't live in true packs, and even if they did, we, as a
different species, wouldn't be a part of them.

## The Negative Impact of Dominance Theory on Dogs and People {.section}

"Dominance" has become the go-to diagnosis for all kinds of problem
behaviors, such as pulling on the leash, jumping up, running through the
door first, inappropriate elimination, destruction, barking, attention
seeking, resource guarding, failure to respond to a command, and
aggression toward animals, other dogs, family members, guests, and
strangers.

To curb these behaviors, punitive trainers often suggest these tactics:

::: hanging01
    • Yank a dog harshly if he pulls.

    • Stop a dog from pulling by using a choke, prong, or shock collar
that will cause him pain if he tries.

    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page24}Knee a jumping dog
in the chest.

    • Keep a dog behind you when you go through a door.

    • Rub a dog's nose in his excrement or urine to punish him for
eliminating in the home.

    • Put a spray or shock collar on a dog to curb barking.

    • Ignore the dog completely whenever he demands affection.

    • Punish a dog by jabbing him with your fingers (supposedly
recreating the "nipping" of a wolf mother to her offspring).

    • Kick or "nudge" a dog in the ribs to get his attention or to
punish him for lunging.

    • Restrain or "alpha roll" him onto his back or side if he
aggresses.

    • Keep a dog below you at all times, denying access to any high
place such as the sofa or bed.
:::

As I mentioned earlier, although dogs can be competitive and controlling
toward people and other dogs (especially when there is a mutual desire
for a valued resource), a dog is *not* demonstrating this socially
inappropriate behavior because he wants to gain *status* over a person.
This misunderstanding really frustrates me because it promotes
confrontational relationships and validates the use of force and fear to
train dogs in an effort to curb their supposed ascent. It's so sad
watching people use choke chains, prong collars, and shock collars to
yank, jerk, and shock their dogs into "behaving," yet no one thinks
anything of it. Imagine if those same people taught children to behave
using choke, prong, or shock collars. How quickly do you think they
would (quite rightly) be called abusers?

Defenders of punishment-based methods in dog training are appalled when
I dare equate teaching dogs with raising and teaching children. As a
mother myself, I am well aware that dogs
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page25}are not children---indeed,
a massive part of my job is to convince owners not to anthropomorphize
their dogs too much!

Modern behavioral science has shown us, however, that the dog's
emotional brain is wired very much like a human's---dogs have emotions
but not a human's level of complexity and ability to extrapolate. It is
vital that people understand this, as it helps immeasurably to achieve
the first step toward understanding our dogs: seeing the world from
their point of view. Furthermore, studies have shown that the most
socially mature dogs have an intelligence and ability to problem-solve
and understand words and gestures similar to that of a two-year-old
human
child.[^8^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c01-nts8){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts8a
.hlink} Dominance trainers might believe that dogs and children are
completely different, but I'm sure even they would think twice about
using aversives if they understood that dogs and toddlers have a similar
level of understanding.

Culturally, we have gradually developed a nuanced approach to raising
children that differs considerably from how we raised children even a
few decades ago. Some may argue that modern views on how best to raise a
confident, successful child are flawed overreactions to the more
draconian, Victorian philosophies used by earlier generations---and to
some extent, they may have a point. But I think most would agree we've
made progress in understanding how children learn, and that far
outweighs any potentially negative side effects of a newly "enlightened"
approach: eschewing physical or emotional punishment of children for
misdeeds or underperformance in favor of rewarding the good in our
children and encouraging humble self-confidence.

As a mother, I am a wholehearted believer in celebrating the goodness of
my daughter while gently and calmly redirecting any unwanted behaviors
through the use of constructive guidance and discipline. I don't scream
at my child or use physical punishment
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page26}for misdeeds. And if her
father and I need to address any negative behavior, we discuss the
choices she made and implement consequences for those choices based on
the situation.

In short, we are raising our daughter using all the same positive
reinforcement philosophies that I use in my dog training. We've made
great strides in how we raise our children; now it's time we do the same
with our dogs.

Children and dogs are vulnerable beings that depend on their family unit
to keep them safe, provide for them, give them confidence, and help them
learn. The better we do as parents to help our children grow, the more
successful they will be as adults. Being a good parent is a learning
process, and it can sometimes be hard to negotiate challenges that are
put in our path. Determining how we discipline our children is as
crucial as how we encourage them to learn and experience life. As "pet
parents" we face the same challenges when raising our dogs. The problem
is, sometimes raising our dogs successfully can be even harder, because
they don't speak our language and we regularly misinterpret theirs. So
we latch onto any information out there that seems to have the potential
to help us, and if we are unfortunate enough to watch the wrong
television show, read the wrong book, or meet the wrong trainer, we will
learn that teaching a dog through force and fear is okay. These trainers
won't be called abusers for training dogs harshly, even though a dog is
just as vulnerable and confused as a small child is without guidance.
Unfortunately, a common mind-set remains that dogs are just dogs and we
can do whatever we like with them to show our dominance and ensure that
we establish ourselves as leaders of the pack, even if that means we
hurt them physically or mentally in the process.

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page27}The Dangers of Punishment {.section}

Decoding the dominance myth is the first step toward creating a truly
balanced and healthy relationship with our dogs. But diminishing the
concept of dominance and hierarchy does more than just make our teaching
more effective---it also keeps us safer.

Attempting to establish dominance over your dog can be very dangerous.
There has been a dramatic rise in the number of reported dog bites in
recent years, and although there are many reasons for this, I believe
confrontational dominance training methods have played a large role. A
study published in the *Journal of Applied Animal Behavior* concludes
that confrontational training methods practiced by many trainers and
handlers are a contributing factor to increased incidences of dog bites.
This scientific study found that many confrontational training methods,
such as hitting dogs, intimidating them with punitive force, and using
techniques of restraint like the "alpha roll," did little to correct
improper behavior and actually increased the likelihood of aggressive
responses.[^9^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c01-nts9){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts9a
.hlink}

Behavior is closely linked to and influenced by emotions, so punishing a
dog for not obeying a command or for unwanted behavior while not
understanding why the behavior is happening (and what emotional effect
it is having on the dog) only serves to make the behavior worse.
Punishments such as leash jerks and collar corrections, hitting, poking,
"nudging," kicking, hanging by the collar, or using electric shock or
spray collars may be effective in suppressing behavior at that moment,
but these techniques do little to solve the problem in the long term and
can make a dog's behavior much worse in the future.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page28}One popular punishment
technique used by dominance trainers is the so-called "alpha roll," in
which the dog is restrained on his back or side until he "calms down."
It may indeed appear that the dog has become quiet and relaxed, but he
has actually employed an instinctive survival tool we call "shut down."
This response is used by animals to appease aggressors and avoid any
further violence. If the dog remains still or "shuts down" until the
aggressor moves away, he is more likely to be safe. Even if a restrained
dog's demeanor appears calm on the outside, research has proven that
forced submission or restraint raises a dog's stress levels, due to a
release of cortisol into the dog's bloodstream. Cortisol is a hormone
that is produced in the adrenal gland and released in response to
stress. Elevated stress inhibits learning and compromises a dog's
ability to function normally. To the untrained eye, a restrained dog's
stillness may indicate that he is calm, but in reality he is fighting an
internal battle of survival as he tries to cope with what is, in
essence, a stressful episode brought on by of an act of physical
violence by a human, in which he is the
victim.[^10^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c01-nts10){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts10a
.hlink} Any "success" that may be achieved when using dominance
techniques on even a mildly aggressive dog is generally just a case of
the dog's "shutting down," suppressing his true instincts and valuable
warning signals. Trying to "put the dog in his place" usually results in
a short-lived quick fix, merely postponing the inevitable negative
response once the dog feels threatened again. This delayed reaction can
easily resurface at the worst possible moment, such as around children
or in public.

A dog that signals his discomfort is much less dangerous than a dog that
has learned to suppress his threat displays because of punishment and
therefore does not give a warning before he bites. As a trainer who
regularly works with aggressive dogs, I rely on such warning signals to
keep me safe, so techniques that result in the suppression of threat
displays and that fail to identify and
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page29}treat the root of the
problem create dogs that are very dangerous. People who use these
techniques are at great risk: they may be bitten or their dogs may bite
someone else.

The tragedy of dominance training techniques is that owners are learning
these methods without realizing that they are making their dogs more
unpredictable and dangerous. Although punishment may bring temporary
relief for a frustrated dog owner's anger, it damages the human-animal
bond and leads to mistrust, pain, fear, agitation, and increasing anger
as the dog develops a strong negative association with the punisher. Far
from treating the underlying motivation of the behavior, punishment
almost always increases the dog's insecurity while decreasing his
ability to learn.

*Ultimately, punishment-based techniques emphasize **what not to do**
instead of helping a dog learn and understand **what to do**.*

I have seen countless trainers give appalling advice to their clients,
for example, telling children (yes, children!) to reprimand their dogs
by yanking their collars or hitting them in the chest or on the nose. I
have seen people get bitten when told to groom their dogs no matter how
much those dogs growled and showed their teeth, just so they could
establish themselves as "alpha." I have seen a trainer wrestle with a
muzzled aggressive dog until it finally submitted and then heard him
declare that the "training" had been a success and the dog
rehabilitated, even though he was still wearing his muzzle and cowering
in the corner.

Think about how you learn. When you're emotional, it's difficult to
think rationally and clearly because your "thinking" brain shuts down.
Once you calm down, your body activates the "thinking" part of your
brain again so that you can listen, digest, and learn, which in turn
deactivates your emotional brain. The same principles are in play with
our dogs. When we treat an aggressive dog with more aggression, not only
do we compromise that dog's
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c01_r1.htm#page30}ability to learn, but the
lasting results from our punitive treatment can range from disappointing
to disastrous.

I feel very sorry for dogs that have been taught using punitive
techniques and have met too many that have been subjected to a
"professional" rough hand and are suffering behavioral issues as a
result. I am not saying that punitive training techniques won't stop a
dog's negative behavior at that moment. They often do, and the results
can sometimes be achieved very quickly, but at what cost to your dog and
at what cost to you? And how long will those results last? Anyone can
make a dog do anything through force and claim the "successful" result
as an impressive achievement, but there is nothing heroic, commendable,
or reliable about dominating any animal into compliance. The beauty of
positive training is that you can build a strong bond with your dog and
teach compliance at the same time: the perfect recipe for a successful
and fulfilling relationship.

# THE POWER OF POSITIVE TRAINING {.subchapter}

So the outdated dominance and punishment-based theories behind
traditional training techniques are flawed. Where does that leave us?
Knowing where dogs come from, what drives them, and how they learn makes
it clear that the most humane, effective, and long-lasting training
methods employ the power of positive reinforcement.

Throughout this book, I'll be relying on your understanding of the
concept of positive reinforcement as we walk through how to overcome and
prevent behavior problems, so it's important at this point to again
clearly define what the term means (and what it does *not* mean).
*Positive reinforcement* can go by many names, all of which are valid:
*reward-based training, science-based training, force-free* or
*pain-free training*, and so on. Regardless of the terminology, the
general theory behind this way of thinking remains the same.

So what exactly is positive reinforcement? Basically, it's simply this:
Your dog learns that good things happen to her when she does the thing
you like. If you give your dog a reward (praise,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#page32}play, food, toys) when she
responds to you or offers an action or a behavior that you like, then
that behavior is likely to be repeated.

Positive-reinforcement teaching techniques use nonconfrontational
methods to work a dog's brain:

    • rewarding positive behavior

    • establishing rituals and training actions that are incompatible
with negative behavior

    • lessening a dog's anger and frustration
:::

And these methods can all be used while enabling the dog to feel good
inside. If you reinforce your dog's desirable behaviors, there is less
chance that she will indulge in other behaviors you don't like. If her
decision making is influenced without the use of force, her trust in you
is not violated.

Using positive techniques to change undesirable behavior requires that
you first determine the cause of the behavior and then figure out how to
modify and change it by giving your dog the ability to learn and feel
differently. Owners who use these techniques learn to connect with their
dogs and work through problems in a humane manner---strengthening the
relationship by fostering mutual trust, providing affection, and
encouraging cooperation. Increasing a dog's enjoyment of social
interaction gives the dog what she needs to deal with the pressures of
domestic life. Dogs that are taught using positive reinforcement methods
are more tolerant and self-controlled and behave much more predictably
in different situations.

It is vitally important for me as a dog trainer to help owners learn how
to give their dogs the things they need to live successfully in our
strange human world. A dog that is given consistent guidance from an
early age grows up to be a confident dog. Guidance brings security,
security brings confidence, and a confident dog has no need to show
anxiety-based behaviors.

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#page33}*Positive* Not *Permissive* {.section}

Most positive trainers do use discipline in the form of vocal
interrupters, time-outs, ignoring negative behavior, or removing
something that the dog wants, all of which are meant to guide the dog
into making the right choices rather than force her to behave out of
fear. In technical terms, such discipline is called *negative
punishment* because it *removes* (*negative* = *minus, less*) something
that the dog likes, such as your attention, access to you, or a favorite
toy. This is by no means to be confused with the term *positive
punishment*, which, though it includes the word *positive*, is defined
as punishing the dog by *adding* something to the equation that the dog
does *not* like (harsh corrections, physical force, intimidation).

Positive training is a much safer method for teaching aggressive dogs
because it changes the way these dogs react by showing them that they
can feel differently about a particular situation, thereby reducing or
eliminating their need to aggress. Using these techniques allows owners
to be proactive rather than reactive and puts the emphasis on teaching
their dog what to do in a certain situation rather than on punishment.

The strongest relationships between dogs and humans are based on
cooperation and kindness rather than on human dominance and animal
submission. Choosing to use positive techniques when building a
relationship with your dog puts you well on your way to establishing and
maintaining increased trust and a stronger, healthier bond between you
and your dog. Put simply, if your dog feels good about you, she will be
happier, confident, better behaved, and more inclined to respond to you
when you ask her to do something.

The process of changing a dog's behavior relies first and foremost on
understanding and patience; successful positive training takes
consistency, repetition, and following these general rules:

::: hanging01
    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#page34}Identify *why* your
dog is doing what she is doing. You cannot effectively deal with a
behavior unless you know the root cause.

    • Once you know why, then you can ask yourself HOW to treat the
behavior. To do this, it is vitally important that you understand your
dog.

    • Learn to communicate clearly. Effective two-way communication
increases the bond between you.

    • Find what motivates your dog and use this while teaching. Rewards
in the form of food, toys, praise, or play are powerful, but every dog
is different, so find out what motivates your dog the most.

    • Be kind: never hit, scream at, or yank your dog. Do not combat
fear with more fear---recognize your dog's concerns, then slowly and
gently help her overcome them.

    • Go very slowly when dealing with anxiety-related behaviors.
:::

This may sound like common sense, but the concepts behind positive
training are still relatively new in the context of our long
relationship with dogs. Not even the most ardent supporter of
punishment-based training can argue that it is more humane to punish
than to reward, but some would argue that punishment in the form of an
electric shock or a swift kick to a dog's ribs is no more damaging or
inhumane than removing a favorite toy. There are degrees of punishment,
and everyone must make their own choices about how far they're willing
to go, but wouldn't you rather avoid doing anything that would make your
dog feel pain or fear if you can help it, regardless of how minimal the
resulting punishment might be?

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#page35}How Dogs Learn {.section}

Traditional compulsion dog trainers sometimes argue that positive
reinforcement doesn't work on more extreme behavior problems. Scientific
study has now revealed what many of us had already deduced: when dealing
with severe aggression and anxiety cases, reward-based, force-free
positive reinforcement teaching is more effective and achieves
longer-lasting results than punitive training
methods.[^1^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c02-nts1){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-nts1a
.hlink} When using positive reinforcement to deal with problem
behaviors, several basic scientific principles are in play---most of
which you will recognize from common life experiences, quite aside from
dog interactions.

Although our dogs learn much the same way that we do, they live in our
human world and their degree of success depends largely on the people
who teach them. Dogs are good social learners, picking up cues and
behaviors by watching and following the behavior of others. For example,
Sadie has always loved to eat grass, chomping away at weeds and fescue
with abandon on nearly every walk. Even though Jasmine had never
experienced the apparent joys of this frustrating (for me) practice, she
now eagerly follows her big brown best friend's lead and seeks out the
tallest, sweetest vegetation on which to munch.

The way dogs learn also depends on genetics, instinct, hormones, senses,
early experience with their mothers and littermates, and ending,
ultimately, with us. Learning begins as soon as a puppy is born, and
humans can help mold that early learning experience so that by the time
a puppy is seven weeks old, she is ready to start exploring and learning
about the world around her.

Effective learning can be compromised by poor health, solitary or
overwhelming environments, forceful training methods, abuse, anxiety,
fear, poor owner compliance, inconsistency, and lack of knowledge. Dogs
are learning from their environment all the time---not just when you are
teaching them.

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#page36}CONDITIONING {.section0}

Thorndike's Law of Effect confirms that behaviors resulting in pleasant
outcomes will be repeated, whereas those that result in unpleasant
consequences will decrease in
frequency.[^2^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c02-nts2){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-nts2a
.hlink} This is called *operant conditioning*. For example, when I ask
Sadie to sit, she is rewarded with food or a toy. She is motivated to
sit again in anticipation of a repeat reward. A word, hand signal, or
both is then associated with the action of sitting.

Dogs also learn by association; this is known as *classical
conditioning*. My dogs get excited each time I open a particular drawer
because they've learned to associate the noise of the drawer opening
with the appearance of their leashes, which almost always results in a
walk. Now the leash is not only *associated* with the walk but also
*reinforced* by the act of walking.

I use *counterconditioning* to teach unruly dogs more appropriate
behavior. If a dog likes to run out the front door whenever it is
opened, I counter the running behavior by teaching the dog to sit and
stay some distance from the door whenever it is opened, which keeps the
dog safe. Sadie used to have an unsavory habit of greeting guests by
sticking her nose in people's crotches. I countered this by teaching her
to get a toy whenever the doorbell rang so that she could only greet
people with the toy in her mouth, which prevented her from sticking her
snout in embarrassing places! Now whenever she hears the doorbell ring,
she runs to get her toy first before heading for the front door to greet
a guest.

*Classical counterconditioning* is a learning process used to help
change a dog's emotional response toward a certain stimulus. For
example, suppose my dog lunges aggressively at another dog she sees in
the distance because she is fearful. Using classical
counterconditioning, I pair the sight of the oncoming dog with something
my dog likes (such as food or a toy), helping her associate
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#page37}the approaching dog with
good things rather than fear of harm. Gradually she feels less fearful
when she sees another dog. This works well as long as she is able to
engage in behavior other than lunging. In this case, I would teach her
an alternative cue, like sitting and looking at me as the dog
approaches. The new cue then becomes an action she can focus on doing
whenever she sees another dog. The sight of a dog, instead of causing
fear, now triggers a different emotional and physical response, and
instead of lunging, my dog immediately chooses to sit and look at me
until the other dog passes by, whereupon she receives her reward. This
kind of counterconditioning can help dogs adapt by gradually exposing
them to a stimulus that previously triggered a reaction; when done
sensitively, it allows learning to take place without a negative
response.

### CLICKER TRAINING {.section}

A clicker is a device that makes a unique clicking sound when pressed.
When the sound is paired with something that the dog really loves, such
as food or a toy, the dog makes the association between the sound and
the reward; the clicking sound then becomes the precursor to a reward.
The clicker is a valuable teaching device because there is no other
sound like it in the dog's domestic world and, as it is processed
quickly in the brain, it is an effective way to mark even the smallest
of actions the dog makes. Small actions can then be shaped into a series
of actions; the series can create a series of movements. For example,
canine freestyle or "doggy dancing"---when dog and owner work together
on an intricate series of moves (sometimes to music)---is a good example
of what can be accomplished with clicker training. Clicker training is
so versatile it can be used across the training spectrum, from teaching
a puppy to sit to calming a reactive dog. The clicker is
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#page38}used not only to shape an
action but also to mark positive changes in behavior and help dogs make
better decisions in emotionally charged situations.

## How to Encourage Your Dog to Listen to You {.section}

Understanding how your dog learns most effectively is the first step
toward a healthy relationship and a well-mannered pet, but it's
impossible to follow through on even the best intentions if you can't
develop a consistent two-way line of communication with your dog. People
often complain that their dogs don't listen to them, but when you think
about it, how often is a dog really going to *want* to do what you're
asking of her? Although you want her to come back to you from the other
end of the park, she may be fully engaged in an investigation of a
fascinating odor or in the midst of an important conversation with
another dog.

Your goal should be to *matter* to your dog, and you can achieve this by
being the source of good things in her life so that she gives you
attention whenever you need it. People often emphasize a need for their
dogs to be *obedient* rather than *cooperative*. Dog owners issue
*commands* rather than focus on teaching the dog *cues* and attaching
those cues to desired actions or behaviors. Motivating your dog to learn
these cues by using rewards that make her feel good will go a long way
toward producing the response you desire, even in the most distracting
environments.

## The Power of Food {#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#ar3 .section}

People who discount the power of reward-based training frown on the use
of food and claim that using rewards to teach dogs is tantamount to
bribery. This frequently repeated claim completely
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#page39}disregards the scientific
fact that food literally alters an animal's brain chemistry and also
suggests a lack of understanding of basic scientific principles that
support how reward-based training (conditioning) works.

Food has the power to help a dog learn and overcome any fear or anxiety
she might have by raising the levels of dopamine in the brain,
stimulating her desire to seek or move toward a reward. Dopamine is a
neurotransmitter that plays a major role in reward-driven learning and
helps regulate movement and emotional responses. When a dog is in the
presence of a stimulus that scares her and is presented with food before
she reaches a high level of stress, the food generates a positive
emotional response. There are circuits in the dog's brain that encourage
seeking or hunting behavior and circuits that elicit the fear response.
When you present food to your dog, you turn on her seeker system,
effectively turning off the
fear.[^3^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c02-nts3){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#c02-nts3a
.hlink} This is one reason why when teaching activities such as scent
work, using food is so valuable for fearful dogs. Turning on the
thinking brain deactivates the emotional brain, enhancing a dog's
attentiveness with positive motivation and allowing her to move into a
calmer state in which learning can take place. In other words, because
food is incompatible with fear, using food for teaching is incredibly
effective, especially when it comes to modifying a dog's anxiety and
stress.

The food you use to motivate your dog to learn must be of high value
until she is responding reliably. Once this has been achieved, you can
start using the high-value food intermittently, which means that your
dog doesn't always get it when she responds to a cue but receives an
alternate, lower-value reward instead. Because your dog is unsure of
when she'll get the high-value food again, she continues to respond in
anticipation of getting it the next time she does what is asked of her.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#page40}Such intermittent
reinforcement actually makes your dog respond more quickly and reliably
because this learning is based on the same concept that makes a casino
slot machine so addictive. It would be wonderful if a slot machine gave
out money every time you played it, but unfortunately that doesn't
happen. The potential, however, that you could win the jackpot with the
very next pull of the lever makes you want to play even more.

## Multi-Motivators {.section}

Even though food treats are a really effective training tool, some dogs
are motivated by other rewards, such as toys, play, praise, or simply
being touched. I have trained many dogs using different types of
rewards---a game of tug, a kind word, or a "life reward," such as a
walk. I also like to vary rewards so the dog never knows what is coming
next or use what I call *multimotivators*, such as a food/toy/praise
combination. Whatever you decide to use, a reward is going to make
learning fun for your dog, improve her confidence, and build up a strong
bond between you.

Remember that the key to cooperation and compliance is trust and
motivation, so the more exciting and valuable you appear to be to your
dog, the more she will listen to you in every situation. When you are in
a new, unfamiliar environment, however, don't be surprised if your dog
ignores you because she's not comfortable---all her mental and physical
energy is most likely being spent on ensuring she is safe. Be aware of
how the environment affects her ability to pay attention to you and know
that if she is having difficulty, it may not be because she is simply
choosing to ignore you.

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#page41}Is Your Dog Hard to Teach? {.section}

Clients often tell me that their dog is stubborn, hard to train, or
lacks intelligence---but in most cases the owner simply hasn't found a
way to encourage the learning process or harness the dog's potential.
Finding the right motivator is key, and although physical enrichment is
vital in the learning process, mental stimulation is equally important.

When a dog is learning, blood flow to the brain increases, bringing
energy to nerve cells. But using up this mental energy can be tiring, so
keep sessions short to help your dog maintain focus, and keep in mind
that each dog learns at her own pace---it is up to you to find out what
that pace is. Dogs also love predictability, so always be consistent to
avoid confusion. For example, if you don't allow your dog up on the
sofa, make sure that all members of your household follow that rule. Be
patient and flexible with your expectations, and be prepared for
failure---it is an important part of the learning process. Finally, once
your dog has learned a particular action or behavior, continue to
reinforce it in everyday life, and never miss a chance to reward
behavior that you like, even if it's just a simple "good girl"---your
dog will love you for it!

# LEADING WITHOUT FORCE  [The Future of Dog Training]{.small1} {.subchapter}

A great leader is one who can positively affect the behavior of others
without using force, like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.
These men were able to alter the course of history and humankind's
progress without firing a gun or raising a fist. Many people suggest
that positive dog trainers lack strength of will or the power to effect
change, but the ability to redirect the misbehavior of the biggest,
strongest, most aggressive dogs, without the use of force, is actually
much more powerful than using punitive methods.

Our goal is to teach, guide, and influence our dogs so they choose to
behave in a positive way. We don't want to get caught up in this
desperate need to show we are the "alpha" or "boss." We just want our
dogs to be happy, fulfilled, and well-mannered.

Yet some people still think that if a dog walks in front of them or
tries to get through the door first, it must be a sign that he wants to
be in charge. In fact, dogs naturally walk faster than us
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c03_r1.htm#page44}because they have four
legs and we have only two and they're just excited to get where they're
headed! If the way they walk bothers us, it's our job to help them learn
to control their pace and excitement levels. If we don't want dogs to
pull on the leash because it's uncomfortable, unsafe, or just really
annoying, we must help them learn to change. We celebrate the purity of
emotion in our pets, yet sometimes we mistakenly assign human
insecurities to the simple joys they relish so innocently.

By now you can see how words like "alpha" and "dominance" have caused a
great deal of confusion in the dog training profession and untold
amounts of stress for our dogs. If you want to have a good relationship
with your dog, show true leadership by rewarding good behavior,
instilling self-confidence, and influencing behavior without the use of
force. Positive reinforcement behavioral principles can work with any
breed of dog and with any issue, from teaching a puppy to learn how to
sit to rehabilitating an aggressive or "red zone" dog.

I remain concerned about the example some old-school trainers are
setting for the new generation of dog owners, trainers, and handlers.
And, as a mother and a regular speaker in schools, I am also aware of
how children are influenced by a respected adult. According to noted
clinical psychologist Dr. Paula Bloom, treating animals harshly in front
of children can be very damaging and sets a terrible
precedent.[^1^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c03-nts1){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-nts1a
.hlink}

I saw this firsthand at a big dog event attended by a large group of
eager, dog-loving kids. Toward the end of the day, a K9 police dog
handler passed by with her gorgeous German Shepherd, and naturally we
all stopped to admire him---just as he decided to sniff the ground by
his side. As he put his head down, the handler gave a quick, forceful
yank on the leash. The scent the dog had found, however, proved to be
too tempting, and again his head went down to sniff it. This time the
officer lifted the []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c03_r1.htm#page45}leash
and jerked the dog so hard that all four paws came off the ground and he
yelped in pain. The kids gasped in shock, and the officer angrily cursed
him. Never one to be mistaken for a quiet bystander, I knew I had to do
something. I approached and asked why she had yanked her dog so hard,
but she didn't take kindly to my question, demanding that I move out of
her way. Instead, I stood my ground and calmly asked her what kind of
example she thought she was setting to the children who had just
witnessed her abusing her dog. She was unable to offer any kind of
explanation for her behavior and pushed passed me, shamefaced and angry.
The children were appalled and visibly shaken by witnessing such
mistreatment.

As parents, teachers, and adults, we need to work out how we can best
handle ourselves and appropriately manage the influence we have on
others. Some may value a dog's obedience more than the relationship, but
I'm glad I'm not one of them. I want a well-behaved dog as much as the
next person, but I'll find other ways to ensure that happens without the
use of force.

## Fear of Change {.section}

I am blessed to have a large, multifaceted public platform and, as you
can see, I'm very vocal about the need to move toward humane training
methods. But the more I speak about the need for change, the more I open
myself up to criticism from those who still practice punitive methods.
The more harshly these critics react, the more their vitriol exposes an
underlying desperation to justify, defend, and hang on to the old ways
that seem to be slipping away. As with ongoing battles to overcome
injustices such as racism and sexism, it is very hard for generations of
people to change their deep-seated beliefs and to admit that there might
be another, better way of doing things. I'm not suggesting that our
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c03_r1.htm#page46}societal struggle over the
evils of racism is on a par with a debate over how to train dogs, but
the principles in play are much the same. It takes time for a culture to
change, but those who are willing to investigate other avenues are most
often the ones responsible for moving society forward. For every
naysayer who attempts to discredit the progress we've made in our
understanding of dog behavior, there are many who celebrate how humane
training has changed the lives of their dogs for the better. Although
counteracting entrenched views is difficult, the beauty and
effectiveness of reward-based training provides a daily reminder that we
can make a dog's learning and life experience better by moving toward a
kinder way of teaching.

A large part of my job as a dog trainer is to find out what motivates
both dog and owner. Almost daily, I deal with intimate human situations
in the families that I work with. These situations can include
infertility, alcoholism, social dysfunction, apathy, and abuse. As any
good dog trainer will tell you, we must be able to identify and manage
not only dog problems but also human issues, and though we're not
formally trained to do so, our to-do list with new clients often
includes some level of psychological assessment.

Even so, I continue to be baffled by one particular human weakness that
unfortunately I see all too often: an unwillingness to change, despite
evidence and overwhelming natural instinct. As Dr. Paula Bloom explains,
"People are susceptible to the influence of people they respect---i.e.,
a professional---and the trust that they put into this person to impart
the right knowledge causes them to remain silent even if they are
uncomfortable with the way their family member is being handled. People
who dominate may have a family history of being dominated themselves,
and because it is naturally difficult for us to feel powerless, we
attempt to counteract this with control. People like to be in
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c03_r1.htm#page47}charge and will defend
even a flawed theory if it aligns internally with something that makes
them feel right. Despite contradictory evidence, many people are not
particularly interested in educating themselves about ideas that might
dissuade them from their deeply held
belief."[^2^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c03-nts2){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-nts2a
.hlink}

Owners often seem to feel that having a poorly behaved dog reflects
badly on themselves. When I go into clients' homes, they regularly
apologize to me about their dogs' behavior. Their dogs embarrass them,
and this embarrassment provokes anger, which is then directed at the dog
in the form of punishment.

Some people may simply enjoy the feeling of power and control that
dominating gives them. We have all encountered such bullies in our
lives. A bully's fear and insecurity manifests itself in a need to
control others. Even though bullies seem strong and in charge, their
behavior betrays an underlying weakness and inability to cope.

How many times since becoming a dog trainer have I witnessed other
trainers and owners using physical or emotional manipulation to exert
control over the dogs they are handling because, like bullies, they are
insecure or fear losing control? It's harder to combat because our
culture celebrates outward shows of strength, and winning the battle is
everything, even if the animal being dominated is under severe stress. I
regularly weather critiques of positive training that reveal an
impatience and unwillingness to treat dogs with the respect they
deserve. For example, during one relatively quick and simple
demonstration of getting a young puppy to learn how to sit using
positive techniques, a small minority were apparently maddened that I
didn't forcibly push the pup's rear onto the ground while saying the
word "sit." Instead of relishing the opportunity to encourage a young
dog to problem solve for himself and experience the joy of learning how
to "get it right," they wanted me to take control. Dominant control
appeals to people's desire
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c03_r1.htm#page48}for quick results and
instant gratification. Force, fear, and pain are quick motivators for
dogs, and many take advantage of that.

Not all trainers and owners who teach dogs in this way are insecure and
desire absolute control. Many are lovely people who genuinely think that
using forceful training methods is the only way to train dogs. They
probably don't realize that what they are doing is damaging in any way.
The mother who pushes her child in a stroller while walking her dog on a
prong collar, the elderly woman who has her dog on a shock collar to
prevent him from chasing squirrels, the millions of people who contain
their dogs with electric fences---all use quick fixes designed simply to
make their lives with dogs as easy as possible, but the damage these
methods are causing is immense.

## The Future of Dog Training {.section}

As a scientist friend of mine is fond of saying, the great thing about
scientific fact is that you are free to disagree with it, but you'll be
wrong.

Though the argument rages on, the debate is over. The world's top
scientists and behaviorists as well as the most respected veterinary
institutions are now warning the public against using compulsion
training and are encouraging owners and trainers to use positive
reinforcement methods instead. In a position statement, the American
Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior (AVSAB) has declared "that
veterinarians not refer clients to trainers or behavior consultants who
coach and advocate dominance hierarchy theory and the subsequent
confrontational training that follows from
it."[^3^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c03-nts3){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-nts3a
.hlink} The AVSAB further states that animal behavior training should
follow the scientifically based guidelines of positive reinforcement,
operant conditioning, classical conditioning, desensitization, and
counterconditioning.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c03_r1.htm#page49}But old habits are hard to
change. It generally takes twenty years for new ideas to be fully
accepted by the general public. Assuming that timeline is correct, I
certainly hope that within a decade all dog trainers and owners will
have switched to using positive methods---I know our dogs will thank us
for it. As Mech states, this isn't just an issue of semantics and
political correctness. Rather, "it is one of biological correctness that
accurately captures the biological and social role of the animals rather
than perpetuate a faulty
view."[^4^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c03-nts4){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-nts4a
.hlink}

It boils down to this---what kind of relationship do you want to build
with your dog? A true bond is built on trust, which can easily be
destroyed when dominance techniques are used. Dogs are thinking,
emotional beings with the ability to solve problems and make the right
choices if we offer them the appropriate guidance. You have the power to
enhance these abilities with humane teaching techniques and give your
dog the chance to be successful in a domestic world. Throw outdated
dominance theory out of the window and embrace modern methods of
teaching. You and your dog will be glad you did.

# BUILDING THE BOND  [Understanding Canine Language]{.small1} {.subchapter}

You cannot build a strong bond with your dog unless you truly understand
how she perceives the world around her, but to do this effectively you
must first learn her language. This chapter will take you deep into your
dog's mind, giving you the foundation you need to build a stronger
relationship and making it easier for you to find effective positive
solutions for any problem behaviors your dog might have.

I was particularly drawn to a career working with dogs in part to
understand how and why we humans came to have such a strong and
sustaining bond with *Canis familiaris*. For thousands of years dogs
have hunted with us, protected our lands, warned us of impending danger,
and brought us comfort. The shared need we both developed for nurture
and companionship meant that dogs became more attuned to humans than to
any other species.

Dogs and humans are biologically similar, because both species are
ultimately driven by their emotional responses. When we pet a dog
lovingly, for example, the warmth and happiness we feel comes from a
release into the bloodstream of
oxytocin---[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page52}a "bonding"
hormone that has a powerful effect on dogs and humans. Dr. Kerstin
Uvnas-Moberg, a doctor and professor of physiology and a pioneer in the
study of oxytocin, studied this hormone release by taking blood samples
from dogs and their owners before and during a petting
session.[^1^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts1){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts1a
.hlink} When owners stroked their dogs, they had a release of oxytocin
similar to what mothers experience while nursing babies. Interestingly,
petting also triggered a burst of oxytocin in the dogs themselves. Miho
Nagasawah, of the Department of Animal Science and Biotechnology at
Azabu University in Japan, showed that even eye contact between a dog
and a human causes an increase in
oxytocin.[^2^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts2){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts2a
.hlink} This interaction between our two species has a powerful
physiological effect on both of us, promoting feelings of love and
attachment while lowering blood pressure and heart rate, soothing pain,
and lessening stress. Studies have shown that people who have dogs are
less likely to suffer from a heart attack and are three to four times
more likely to survive one if they
do.[^3^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts3){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts3a
.hlink}

Dogs are so bonded with us that they, like humans, show a relatively
high level of social intelligence. Dogs can mimic our behavior and read
our facial expressions the same way we attempt to read theirs, enabling
us to connect on an emotional level despite our tendency to find each
other's language confusing. When humans look at a person's face, their
eyes tend to wander to the left, falling on the right-hand side of the
face. This "left gaze bias" happens only when we encounter faces, not
objects, because the right side of the human face is better at
expressing our emotional state. Studies at the University of Lincoln in
the United Kingdom have shown that dogs also have this left gaze bias,
but for them it happens only when looking at a human face---not an
object or the face of another dog. Researchers believe that dogs
developed this skill through their relationship with humans, possibly as
a way to protect themselves from human anger or
threat.[^4^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts4){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts4a
.hlink}

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page53}In addition to our ability
to form social relationships, another bonding trait shared by both
humans and dogs is our love of play. Play develops social skills, is
important for mental and physical growth, allows us to enjoy activities
that make us feel good, and enhances the connection between us.

## Canine Intelligence {.section}

Buster, a food-obsessed Terrier, was one of the smartest dogs I've ever
met. His owners had constructed a barricade in their home designed to
prevent Buster from getting into the kitchen and stealing food from the
countertops, but somehow he always found ingenious ways to break through
it. His problem-solving skills were so advanced that even when faced
with seemingly impossible new challenges, he ultimately found new ways
to solve them. For example, thanks to his nifty nose and his odd desire
to urinate on the kitchen appliances, Buster had perfected a rather
novel approach to getting onto the countertop, which we discovered by
setting up remote cameras in the kitchen area and watching what they
captured live from another room. This clever little dog was too small to
simply jump up onto the counter; instead he used his paws to scrabble
open the oven door and jump onto it. From this vantage point he opened a
drawer next to the oven, and from there it was an easy leap onto the
kitchen countertop. Buster proceeded to open anything that might contain
food (including the microwave and cookie jar), ate whatever he could
find, then promptly and contentedly relieved himself on the bread
container. Nothing was safe if Buster was left alone in the kitchen.

As I have previously stated, a dog's ability to solve problems and make
choices is comparable to that of a two-year-old human child---far beyond
the capabilities of most other animals. But although comparing canine
and human intelligence may provide
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page54}us with valuable insight,
it does not take into account dogs' exceptional sensory capabilities and
problem-solving skills. Dogs like Buster are very good at adapting to
different situations, identifying problems in their environment, and
coming up with further clever solutions if needed.

In addition to being great problem solvers, dogs have exceptional
physical skills, moving their bodies fluidly through daily life while
still understanding the parameters of what they can and cannot do. They
also have an amazing ability to understand and respond to cue words that
we give them---provided we teach them correctly.

Dogs have very good memories. Oxytocin is the hormone responsible for
social memory, enabling dogs to recognize people and other animals they
have previously met, thereby allowing them to retain social attachments.
Dogs also remember, among other things, where they have hidden a bone;
where their leash is hung; associations among words, objects, and
actions; and emotionally significant life events. Here's an example.
While hiking through the North Georgia mountains one summer day, Sadie
was stung by a bee. The experience was so traumatic for her that now,
whenever she hears or sees a bee, her tail goes between her legs and she
runs away. Six months later, in the dead of winter, we were walking
along the same mountain path, and as soon as we approached the creek
bend where she had been stung, Sadie's ears went back and she took off.
I looked around to see what had scared her and then realized we were at
the very place where she had been stung the previous summer. Not only
had she made an association between the sound of a bee and feeling pain,
but she also remembered the exact place where the traumatic event had
happened.

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page55}Body Language {.section}

Dogs communicate with us and each other by using a complex system of
body signals that we humans often miss or don't understand. Before I
start working with any client, I spend time simply observing their dogs
with them, because it always surprises me how little people know about
how their dogs communicate. Gradually, my clients gain a new
appreciation for the canine experience by watching how their dogs
"talk," and the changes they make in response to what they see often
improve the human/canine relationship dramatically.

Misreading a dog's signals can lead to confusion and conflict. One
dramatic example of misreading and misunderstanding behavior was the
case of a Chihuahua, Niles, who lived with Karen, a lovely lady in
Birmingham, England. Previously Karen had only ever owned cats, but when
her last beloved cat died, she decided it was time to get a dog. She
picked a Chihuahua mainly because, as she sheepishly admitted, the breed
is roughly the same size as a cat. After a relatively normal start in
life, Niles developed a chronic aversion to being touched, eventually
hating to be handled so much that he bit Karen each time she attempted
to get close to him.

Karen loved Niles but couldn't understand why her beloved dog didn't
feel the same. He followed her everywhere, slept on her bed, and became
anxious when she left, but he simply would not let Karen near him when
she wanted to show him affection. I watched Niles with fascination as he
snarled and bared his teeth at us, because he was one of the best canine
communicators I'd ever seen. Niles wore his heart on his paw and clearly
signaled his intentions, so I was amazed that Karen misunderstood what
he was trying to say. From the beginning of my time with them, I knew
this relationship was salvageable as long as Karen developed a clearer
understanding of canine body language.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page56}Whenever Karen approached,
Niles turned his head sideways but kept his eyes firmly fixed on her.
His mouth closed tightly as he took a step back, turned his body away,
and lifted his front paw. If Karen continued to approach, he blinked
rapidly, licked his lips, tucked his tail between his legs, and froze.
When she reached out to touch him, his lip curled so that his teeth were
exposed; he growled deeply and then snapped. As soon as Karen moved away
from him, Niles stood up tall, raised his tail, and shook his body as if
trying to get water off his back.

I found out that because Karen had loved stroking her cats, poor Niles
had been petted continually as a puppy. Though tolerant of this at
first, he had grown tired of the constant handling. When his peaceful
"back off" signals didn't work, Niles learned that snapping and biting
was the only effective way to get Karen to back away from him. He lived
in fear of being handled, making it very hard for her to even attach the
leash onto his collar and take him for a walk.

The situation did indeed seem desperate, but within the space of a few
hours, the relationship between Karen and Niles took a dramatic turn. It
was a great relief for her to learn that the remedy was a relatively
simple one and that she no longer had to battle with what she thought
was a dominant dog.

To understand how I solved this conundrum, let's delve in to some
relevant background information. Dogs communicate using a complex
language of body signals that reflect what they are thinking and
feeling. These signals are used, consciously and unconsciously, to
communicate intent and ensure personal safety by *positively* affecting
behavior in others. One dog might try to appease another by actively
seeking attention via one or more of the following behaviors: muzzle
and/or ear licking, jumping up, lowering and curving the body, blinking,
clacking or exposing the teeth ("smiling"), lip licking, lowering the
head and ears, or []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page57}play
bowing. Although much appeasement consists of active body language,
passive submission such as cowering and body freezing seems to be a
response to escalating fear in the presence of a perceived threat. A
socially experienced dog receiving these signals will tolerate this
language of appeasement and reciprocate with appropriate signals; other,
less experienced dogs might take advantage of this deference and attempt
to control or aggress.

In addition to appeasement, dogs commonly use displacement signals to
avoid confrontation. These signals are used during an uncomfortable or
stressful situation to provide a distraction and to cover up what the
dog is really feeling. Yawning, sniffing, scratching, sneezing, and
licking are all active behaviors that also keep dogs calm. I use similar
displacement behaviors when I first go into the homes of dogs that are
fearful and/or aggressive toward humans. Rather than having any visual
or physical contact with the dog, I pretend to read a magazine, write on
a clipboard, or look at a book. These activities take my attention away
from the dog, which relieves pressure by providing something else for
her to focus on. These displacement activities also help mask any
tension *I* may be feeling and keep my body language fluid and my
breathing relaxed. Dogs easily pick up on human tension, so even
standing with my weight on one hip and breathing normally while
"reading" a book helps a dog relax in my presence. I sometimes have
owners teach their guests this behavior when entering the home of a dog
that is fearful of strangers, and I find it works wonders.

Some dogs show ultimate deference by urinating or by rolling over and
exposing their bellies. Misinterpreting a common signal like this can
lead to disastrous results. During filming for the pilot episode of
*It's Me or the Dog*, Blue, a nervous Old English Sheepdog, rolled over
and showed his stomach to a construction worker working on the house
next door. Mistakenly assuming that Blue wanted his belly rubbed, the
man crouched down and
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page58}began stroking him, only
to be swiftly bitten on the hand. Far from inviting the stranger to pet
him by freely exposing the most vulnerable part of his body, Blue was
actually offering an appeasement gesture in the hope that the man would
go away. From his point of view, once the man seemingly ignored these
signals, Blue felt he had no choice but to bite in order to protect
himself. Some socially inexperienced dogs may not always recognize the
signals that other dogs give them, but humans certainly have much to
learn and fewer excuses for getting it wrong.

Tail wagging is another frequently misinterpreted signal. Most people
believe that a wagging tail means that a dog is happy, which of course
is true in many cases, but some dogs also wag their tails when aroused,
overstimulated, and frustrated. You can usually tell the difference by
looking at what the rest of the body is doing:

::: hanging01
    • A confident or aroused dog will hold her tail in the air, allowing
scent from the anal glands to circulate more freely and advertise her
presence.

    • A dog that is wagging her tail but barking with a defensive body
posture, tense face, and hard staring eyes is overly aroused and
frustrated, which means that she should not be approached.

    • A tail that is held low or between the legs signals a lack of
confidence, nervousness, or fear.

    • A tail that is held high but wagged more slowly means that the dog
is curious and assessing a situation.

    • A tail that is extended and curved means that the dog is tense and
ready to take offensive or defensive action.

    • A tail that wags around and around like a helicopter and is
accompanied by relaxed fluid body movement and a wiggling bottom signals
friendliness and a willingness to engage.

    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page59}Research has shown
that when a dog sees a person she likes, her tail wags more to the
right. When she sees an unfamiliar person, her tail wags more to the
left. Subtle body language like this is easy to miss.
:::

The tail is important for both balance and signaling, which is why the
practice of tail docking, or partial removal of a dog's tail, is so
harmful. Because the tail is a prime indicator of mood, dogs with docked
tails are unable to communicate properly with that part of their body,
meaning that other dogs and people miss vital signals.

Niles used many of the signals I have described to appease and distract
his owner, but until I made Karen aware, it seemed as though they were
usually just ignored. Karen was so intent on showing Niles that she was
the boss in the relationship that she was oblivious to his tension. She
paid the price by receiving some nasty bites.

I wanted Karen to show Niles that she understood and respected his
wishes by giving him much-needed space. I knew paying him less attention
and giving him some room would relieve the pressure he felt, and in time
he would be comfortable enough to seek out attention from her. At first
Niles was a little confused with the change in Karen's behavior, but
after a few days he began to approach her. When a nervous and fearful
dog realizes he has some control over a situation, he gains confidence.
Karen was to praise him whenever she saw him relax, and if he asked for
attention, she acknowledged it with vocal communication only. Even when
Niles came to sit beside her or on her lap, he felt comfortable because
he knew he could do so without being touched. Gradually, as trust slowly
developed between them, Karen gently handled him, rewarding his calm
acceptance with gentle praise and a food treat. Starting with one touch
at a time and building up gradually helped Niles appreciate close
contact. []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page60}Karen now
understood his language so well that she responded appropriately
whenever she sensed that Niles had had enough.

The issue of attaching the leash was also easily resolved. Instead of
fumbling with his collar, I gave Karen a clothbound slip leash that she
was able to casually slip over his neck as she walked past him, under
the pretence of doing something else. Because Niles never knew when the
leash was coming, he never showed any signs of stress. As soon as the
leash was around his neck he happily went outside. I don't like to use
slip leashes as a general rule because of their tendency to tighten
around a dog's neck, so as soon as we were outside, I showed Karen how
to attach his regular leash and remove the slip. Because Niles was so
distracted in a more stimulating environment, he never showed any
negative reaction to this change. Karen continued with this strategy for
a month until she got to the point where she could attach the leash to
his collar inside the house with no problem. She also taught Niles
action cues such as "sit," "lie down," and "touch," rewarding him for
his compliance. Niles loved and responded well to these training
sessions.

Touch training or "targeting" is useful in many situations and helps
nervous dogs accept a person's touch or see an approaching hand as
something positive rather than a threat. It's also a great cue to
motivate a dog to come when called. This cue should be taught to every
puppy and dog to prevent hand shyness from ever developing.

## Teaching the Touch Cue {#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#ar2 .section}

::: hanging01
    • Dogs are naturally curious animals, so start this technique by
presenting your hand to your dog. As she goes to investigate your hand
and touches it with her nose, praise and reward her.

    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page61}Take your hand away,
put it behind your back, wait a second or two, and then present it
again.

    • Repeat this exercise until your dog is touching your hand whenever
you present it.

    • When your dog is good at this task, start adding the word "touch"
as she goes to touch your hand with her nose. After many repetitions you
will find that she will respond as soon as you ask her to "touch."

    • Try this exercise with both hands so that she gets used to
touching either one.

    • When she is reliably touching your hand, use this cue around the
home. Call your dog to come to you, and as she gets close, extend your
hand and ask her to "touch."

    • Every touch should be rewarded at this point---some with praise
and others with a treat.

    • When your dog is responding well indoors, take the exercise
outside where there are more distractions.

    • Gradually increase the distance between you so that your dog has
to travel farther to touch your hand.
:::

Niles's behavior changed rapidly, and Karen was amazed. Within a month,
a dysfunctional relationship had turned into one that was mutually
respectful, because both dog and owner finally understood each other and
became more confident in the other's presence. Niles's newfound security
meant he no longer reacted defensively to being touched and actively
encouraged a more hands-on relationship.

Any signal a dog demonstrates must always be read in the context of
whatever other body signals or vocal language the dog is displaying at
the time. Similar signals have different meanings in different
situations, so the position of the body and other vocal signals will

## The Value of Dog-to-Dog and Human-Dog Play {.section}

Sadie and Jasmine love to play together. Their size difference doesn't
seem to affect their ability to enjoy one another; they just make it
work. Sadie lies down on her side with her mouth open as Jasmine jumps
around her head putting her tiny Chihuahua mouth on parts of Sadie's
large muzzle. Both dogs make a lot of noise during their mock battle,
showing their teeth and flashing the whites of their eyes. Then as
quickly as it starts, play stops---for
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page66}a brief moment. Sadie
sneezes, and Jasmine turns around to lick her flank before leaping back
to spar with her best friend.

Dog-to-dog play is a series of active and repetitive behaviors that have
different meanings depending on context. These behaviors help dogs
develop important life skills and experiences that promote good physical
and mental health. Because safe play relies on the dog's ability to read
vocal and body signals, dogs that don't have the opportunity to play are
usually deficient when it comes to communicating and identifying these
signals. These dogs tend to play rudely: body slamming, mouthing too
hard, mounting, and generally causing mayhem. Most well-socialized dogs
are quite adept at playing and reading social language in others, and
while some will tolerate rude play behavior, others will only take so
much battering from a rambunctious bully. If your dog is pushy or plays
too rough, interaction with other dogs should cease until she learns to
greet and play nicely. Teaching a reliable recall will help keep play
appropriate because calling your dog back before things get too rowdy
will give her time to calm down before reintroducing her back into the
group.

Appropriate play can be rough, but human intervention is usually not
needed. As long as each dog allows the other to win and lose the game,
the potential for conflict is avoided. The more aroused dogs become,
however, the more likely it is that the mock battle will turn into
something more serious. Good players are confident and actively seek out
other dogs to play with, maintaining order during play by using clear
signals so that the dogs they're playing with don't become too aroused
or overwhelmed.

Play begins in puppyhood and helps puppies develop good coordination
while allowing them to practice a series of exaggerated behaviors that
promote social ease. The beauty of play is that for most dogs the desire
to interact with others in such a manner continues into adulthood. Sadie
is now ten years old, yet when she
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page67}dives into her play bow
and runs around with her mouth wide open, her tongue hanging to one
side, and a twinkle in her eye, she looks as vibrant as a young pup.
Both my dogs have learned to play safely with each other, relying on a
series of cut-off signals that communicate their peaceful intentions.
Play bows, sniffing, sneezing, yawning, itching, and licking occur for
brief moments throughout play to communicate that any future action is
still just play.

Playing with dogs also helps increase the human-animal bond. Most dogs
love to play a game of fetch or tug of war with their owners and like to
use their supreme sense of smell to locate hidden objects. There are
many fantastic activities you can do with your dog that cater to her
instinctive drive to seek out food or prey. Because Sadie is a Labrador,
she loves to retrieve things that I hide for her and is particularly
fond of locating toys that I dab with duck scent. Fortunately for Sadie
this scent comes in a bottle I can buy at my local pet shop. The scent
motivates her to search for any toy that I put it on. I call this
activity the "go find it" game. Here is how you play it:

::: hanging01
    • Begin by dabbing a little scent on a toy and hiding it.

    • Allow your dog to see where you hide the toy.

    • Dab some of the same scent on a piece of cloth and let your dog
smell it.

    • Tell your dog to "go find" the toy.

    • If your dog has trouble locating the "hide," guide her with
encouragement to the place where the toy is "hidden" and praise her when
she finds it.

    • Make hides easy to begin with by placing the toy closer; then, as
she becomes more proficient, gradually increase the distance between
your dog and the hide.

    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page68}When she is finding
the hide reliably, take her away from the area and hide the toy so that
she can't see where you are hiding it.

    • Encourage her to "go find" again.

    • If your dog likes to scent the ground, you can make it easier for
her to find the toy by dabbing some scent on the ground leading to the
area where it is hidden.
:::

There are many great games for dogs that like to chase things, my
favorite being "toy on a stick." This toy can be purchased or made at
home by attaching a soft toy to some rope, tying it to a stick, and
whirling it around your body. Both my dogs love this game, and ten
minutes of chasing tires them out for hours. Jasmine also loves to chase
birds and squirrels, and "toy on a stick" actually helps me cue when she
can chase them. Before the game starts, I point my finger in her
direction and tell her to "wait." Jasmine has to be completely still for
a short period of time until I give her the cue to "go chase" the toy.
This game translates well when I have her outside in an off-leash area.
If it's safe for her to indulge in her favorite pastime---chasing
squirrels---then I allow her to do so, but only on my cue. If the time
is not appropriate, I use the wait signal and attach her leash to
redirect her to something else. She has now learned to respond to "wait"
even if the cue doesn't always end in an opportunity to chase, because
the potential to indulge in the passion is often reinforced. I'm a great
believer in allowing dogs to satisfy their instinctive needs if
appropriate, but having the behavior occur on cue means I can safely
control Jasmine in any environment.

I believe one of the reasons why we connect with dogs so well is our
mutual desire to play. Any activity, whether it's a simple game in your
backyard or something you do with your dog as a team sport, will keep
you both mentally and physically fit while
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page69}building a stronger
relationship between you. Allowing your dog to play with other dogs in
your household and organizing play dates with canine friends will help
your dog rehearse valuable play behavior and maintain healthy social

To truly understand how dogs perceive the world, it is important to
learn about their sensory experience. Senses are closely linked to
emotions, and emotions drive behavior, so it stands to reason that even
though we are just scratching the surface when it comes to understanding
the dog's sense capabilities, they play an integral part in the dog's
experience. I love using the senses to help dogs learn and work through
any behavioral issues they might have---a process I call *sensory
education*.

### SIGHT {#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#ar4 .section}

A dog's visual system does not dominate the brain as it does in humans,
meaning that dogs are less reliant on sight for information. However,
breeds such as Retrievers, Sighthounds, and Sheepdogs are very good at
detecting even the smallest movements in the distance, and they rely on
this ability to detect moving prey and retrieve game. Because dogs are
much lower to the ground than humans, they obviously see the world from
a very different perspective. People who own small dogs tend to forget
what the world must look like to them, so lying on the ground helps shed
a little light on their small dog's visual experience.

Humans can see about 180 degrees around them, whereas dogs, depending on
their eye placement, can see approximately 250 degrees, especially if
their eyes are located more toward the side of their heads. Dogs are
able to see much better in dim light
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page70}because the central
portion of the dog's retina is composed primarily of rod cells that see
in shades of gray, whereas human central retinas primarily have cone
cells that perceive color. Rods need much less light to function than
cones do. The tapetum, a mirrorlike structure in the back of a dog's eye
that reflects light, gives the retina a second chance to register light
that has entered the eye. It is thought that a dog can see four times
better than a human in low light, which provides an ideal environment
for catching prey. Dogs also have what is known as *dichromatic vision*,
meaning they see only part of the range of colors in the visual spectrum
of light wavelength. They are unable to see the red to green spectrum
but can see in shades of yellow and blue. I've never understood why so
many dog toys are colored red when both red and green appear as gray or
black to a dog. So a red toy on green grass just looks like gray on more
gray, which explains why some dogs don't see toys that are thrown for
them even though the difference in color looks very obvious to us.

Dogs have a third eyelid that acts like a windshield wiper, clearing
debris from the eye---much needed when you are closer to the ground.
Large pupils mean that dogs don't have great depth of field in their
vision, so when looking at things in the distance, they can focus
clearly only on objects in the center of their vision. Everything else
around this center is blurry. In dim light, the dog's vision degrades
from 20/20 to 25/70. This means dogs can see fine details only to a
maximum distance of twenty feet away, whereas a person with good
eyesight can see them at seventy-five feet. This limitation probably
explains why Jasmine has a hard time recognizing a family member coming
toward her until they wave their arms or come closer. Active hand
signals are easy to see and recognize even from far away.

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page71}HEARING {.section}

Have you ever seen your dog suddenly cock her head to one side as if she
is listening to something? How about when she shoots up and barks at the
wall or runs to the front door to welcome a family member home well
before the car turns into the driveway and the door is opened? The human
ear can detect frequencies of up to 20,000 Hertz (Hz), whereas dogs can
hear frequencies up to 45,000 to 67,000
Hz.[^5^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts5){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts5a
.hlink} This makes them more effective hunters, locating hidden prey
just from the high-pitched squeaks small animals make. Jasmine often
tilts her head to one side and then pounces on the ground in front of
her, digging furiously to get to whatever she has heard burrowing; her
Terrier ears pick up the slightest sound of prey deep underneath her.
Dogs with pricked ears can better detect a sound source than drop-eared
breeds, but all dogs can move their ears around like satellite dishes,
picking up sound from every direction.

Puppies are born deaf, but their ears open at two weeks of age, and by
one month their hearing is exceptional. However, noted sound researcher
Joshua Leeds believes that because sound is absorbed through the entire
body, a puppy may actually be able to hear in utero and at birth, just
as hearing-impaired humans feel the pulse of music through their
skin.[^6^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts6){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts6a
.hlink}

Although most dogs are able to filter out offensive sounds, others
suffer from noise sensitivity disorders, developing fears and phobias to
noises such as fireworks, thunder, and sirens. Household appliances that
mean little to us in terms of sound can really hurt a dog's sensitive
ears. Vacuum cleaners, roaring garbage trucks, or the cries of a baby
cause misery for many dogs. I once worked with a dog that was terrified
of going into the kitchen. To find out what was scaring him, I lay on
the floor by the kitchen entrance, and as I did so, my ears picked up a
low rumbling []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page72}coming from
my left. The air vent from the refrigerator emitted a deep hum that was
almost undetectable at a human level but very loud from the dog's point
of view. To test this theory, I turned the fridge off. Five minutes
later the dog walked into the kitchen with no hesitation. When I took
him out and turned the fridge back on again, he refused to go back in,
even when presented with his favorite food as a lure. It was clear that
the noise from the fridge was the culprit.

The Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov discovered that dogs are so
sensitive to tonal changes that they can detect even the most minute
changes of pitch between two notes. With this in mind, I discovered that
dogs can recognize certain types of music just as they recognize the
sound of your car engine. I then discovered that there was another way
to help dogs get over certain sound sensitivities and anxieties, by
using music as part of a *sensory education* program. Working with the
creators of Through a Dog's Ear, whose specially designed
psycho-acoustic music helps to calm dogs in all environments ranging
from the home to the shelter, I developed the Canine Noise Phobia
Series, which pairs psycho-acoustic music and sound effects with a
behavioral protocol designed to help a dog overcome sensitivities to
certain sounds (see
[Resources](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_res_r1.htm){.hlink}). I have
received very positive feedback about this series, which thankfully is
now helping dogs overcome their fear of offending noises all over the
world. (For more on its use, see [chapter
7](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm){.hlink} on separation distress
and anxiety and [chapter 8](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm){.hlink}
on thunderstorm phobia.)

### SMELL {.section}

Although a dog's brain is just one-tenth the size of a human brain, the
part of the brain that is devoted to analyzing smells is forty times
greater than that of a human's. A dog's sense of smell is therefore
estimated to be a hundred thousand times better than
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page73}ours. Animal psychologist
Alexandra Horowitz suggests that smell may be one way a dog perceives
the passing of time. When a dog catches a scent on the air, it is seeing
the future by smelling what is to come---and smelling odors on the
ground is like scenting the
past.[^7^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts7){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts7a
.hlink}

The physiology of a dog's nose is incredible. According to animal
psychologist Stanley Coren, a dog's nose print is as individual as a
human's
fingerprint.[^8^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts8){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts8a
.hlink} Mobile nostrils that move independently from each other gather
scent from all directions. Mucus on and inside the nose helps keep the
nose skin or "leather" cool but also acts like sticky velcro, trapping
scent molecules, which are then dissolved into the mucus and pushed up
through the nose by tiny hairs called cilia. The average dog produces a
pint of this mucus every day. When a dog sniffs, it disrupts its normal
breathing process to gather scent. Sniffing prevents too much of the
scent from being exhaled so that more of the scent can be identified.
The nostrils lead to a bony shelflike structure where scent is trapped,
and information gathered by receptor cells is then sent to the olfactory
bulbs and on to the brain for processing.

"If a dog's sense of smell is so good, why do they smell each other's
bottoms?" my daughter asked me one day. It was a fair question and one
that I am often asked. Smelling the anogenital area of another animal
may seem revolting, but this activity gives dogs plenty of information
about the animal they are smelling. Dogs have what is known as a
*vomeronasal organ*, which is located above the hard palate of the mouth
just behind the incisors, at the base of the naval cavity. The
information received through this organ goes straight to the part of the
brain that processes emotional memory---the limbic system. It is
believed that this organ helps detect *pheromones* (chemical messages
that are produced by glands, urine, and
feces).[^9^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts9){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts9a
.hlink} Even though a dog's body is covered
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page74}with glands, there is a
large concentration of them in moist areas such as the anus, the ears,
and around the mouth. A dog can tell the age, sex, reproductive status,
and health of the recipient just by smelling these areas. It is also
thought that dogs can detect changes of emotional state in other dogs
and animals by smelling the concentration of stress chemicals in the
secretions. For example, there is some truth to the belief that dogs can
smell fear. Human sweat carries odors that change depending on the
concentration of hormones in the body. When a person is stressed or
fearful, adrenaline is released into the bloodstream, which elevates the
heart rate and increases sweat production. A dog can easily detect when
a human is stressed by the release of these chemicals along with body
tension and shallow breathing.

When dogs urinate or defecate they are effectively marking their space
and leaving behind information about themselves---the canine version of
a business card or "pee-mail." When a dog rubs up against you, she may
be doing it out of love and to get attention, but she may also be
depositing her scent on you. Some dogs will go to great lengths to
distribute their scent as far as possible by releasing spurts of urine
at different times in different locations to cover a wider area. Sadie
scrapes her back paws along the ground after she has toileted, spreading
her scent by pushing it up into the air and leaving secretions on the
ground from the glands located between her paw pads. I have seen many
dogs literally doing handstands to get their urine as high as possible
as well as dogs that poop up against walls or on raised surfaces such as
a bush or mound of grass. After all, getting your message out at nose
height makes it easier for others to read all about you.

As I mentioned earlier in this chapter, scent goes straight to the
limbic system that regulates mood and drives emotions and memory. By
using food when teaching, I am able to harness a
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page75}dog's powerful sense of
smell to help her learn and achieve emotional stability---an important
part of sensory education. As I explained in chapter 2, food is an
important part of the learning process and can help nervous and anxious
dogs overcome their fears. Using other scents, such as synthetic
dog-appeasing pheromone or lavender, helps lessen anxiety by promoting
feelings of
calm.[^10^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts10){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts10a
.hlink} Putting a shirt with your scent on it in your dog's bed can help
her cope during your absence. Encouraging your dog to learn by using
scent work to improve her mental and physical state is a way of
utilizing her sense of smell to encourage her to perform tasks that
enrich her life and help her overcome any emotional issues she may have.
If I'm working with a particularly nervous dog that is not responding to
food, I warm up the food, releasing scent molecules and stimulating the
digestive system. Even a fearful dog has a hard time resisting warmed-up
hot dog.

Humans have long harnessed the dog's keen sense of smell by using them
to search for and rescue people and to detect items as diverse as bombs,
drugs, agricultural products, termites, mold, bedbugs, and accelerants.
Because dogs process each smell separately (a skill known as odor
layering), they can filter out other scents that might distract them
from doing their job. Dogs are now being used to detect cancer, alert
people with epilepsy to an impending seizure, and detect low and high
blood sugar levels in diabetics.

A dog's sense of smell can be hampered by illness or old age or by being
overheated and actively panting (because the dog is using its
inhalations to cool itself rather than for detecting scents). These
factors can reduce the sense of smell by as much as 40 percent. If your
dog is cool, young, and healthy, though, her nose knows no bounds!

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page76}TASTE {.section}

Considering the way Sadie gulps down her food at every meal, I often
wonder whether she can really taste anything. Taste and smell are
closely linked, and although a dog's sense of smell is superior to ours,
their tasting abilities are probably not as sensitive. A dog has only
1,700 taste buds, far fewer than the 9,000 taste buds we
have.[^11^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts11){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts11a
.hlink} Dogs can detect sweet, salty, sour, and bitter tastes, but it's
doubtful they can discern subtle taste differences in food as easily as
humans can.

Water is the only liquid I like drinking, and I have developed such a
"taste" for it that I'm now extremely sensitive to changes in any water
I drink. A dog's sense of taste for water lies on the tip of her
tongue---the part that laps the water up. When a dog eats salty or
sugary food, her sensitivity to the taste of water
increases.[^12^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts12){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts12a
.hlink} This ability may have evolved as a way of encouraging a dog to
drink and keep hydrated while eating meat that is naturally high in
salt. I like to believe that in respect to water, my taste is very much
like a dog's.

Taste deterrents such as bitter apple or lemon are designed to prevent
dogs from chewing things that they shouldn't. These substances are
frequently put on furniture, walls, or whatever the dog is chewing in
order to stop the behavior, but I've found that they often don't achieve
the desired result. In my experience, some dogs actually *like* the
taste of these substances, licking them off quickly to get to the other
good stuff underneath. In this case I manage the situation by removing
the object or preventing access.

### TOUCH {.section}

As soon as a puppy is born, she relies on touch to find her mother, to
stimulate milk flow for feeding, and as a source of comfort. Mothers in
turn lick and nuzzle their puppies from birth, improving the puppies'
circulation and encouraging them to eliminate waste in
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page77}order to stay healthy.
Touch helps form emotional bonds between a mom and her pups that can
then be transferred to humans. It is really important that a puppy
experience human touch from birth to promote a human/canine attachment
and encourage the puppy's ability to develop social attachments with
others as she grows.

If you look at your dog's face you will see that she has fine hairs or
whiskers above the eyes, on the muzzle, and below the jaw on the side of
the muzzle. These whiskers, or vibrissae, are so sensitive that when a
dog approaches an object, she can sense changes in airflow long before
she actually touches it. Because whiskers are so sensitive, take care
when examining the inside of your dog's mouth or brushing her teeth, and
don't buy into the whole practice of whisker trimming---those hairs are
there for a reason.

Some dogs have an automatic defensive reflex to hands that come toward
them or extend over their heads. This could be because the whiskers on
top of the eyes itch or hurt when touched, but it's also possible that
the dog views a hand stretching over her head as threatening. When a
puppy is young, this reflex is not under conscious control, so it is
vital to desensitize the puppy or dog to accept an approaching hand
because this scenario is going to happen many times throughout life.
(See [Teaching the Touch
Cue](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#ar2){.hlink}.) Touch
sensitivities vary from dog to dog, but you should always use care when
touching the head, muzzle, tail, abdomen, and paws.

Nerve endings along the dog's spine and toward the tail make the back a
particularly sensitive area but one where most dogs like to be touched.
Sadie enjoys scooting along the grass on her back, rubbing back and
forth as she does so. The first few times I saw this I was concerned
that she might be in pain, but thankfully it turns out that she just
really enjoys a good back scratch.

A dog's paws are so sensitive they can detect different textures and
vibrations in the ground. I remember seeing video of a dog
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page78}suddenly freezing and
bolting from a room. His owners were still wondering what had spooked
him when, thirty seconds later, an earthquake struck. It was obvious
that the dog had felt the vibrations in the ground long before his
family had. Foot sensitivity is probably why so many dogs hate having
their paws touched or nails clipped.

Habituating a pup to being touched from birth is extremely important as
early pleasant experiences of human handling set a dog up for a lifetime
of acceptance. Rubbing a nervous dog's chest in a circular motion can be
very soothing, but if you want to go the extra mile, investing in a
professional canine masseuse is a great way to help your dog
relax.[^13^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts13){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts13a
.hlink} Do this only if your dog likes being touched. For dogs that,
like Niles, are stressed by too much handling, these therapies are not a
good idea!

## Be Mindful {.section}

As we learn more about what makes dogs tick, we can make their life
experience better. Whenever I go into a home with a dog that is
struggling to cope, I focus on finding ways to relieve some of the
pressure she feels. Simple solutions, like placing the dog's bed in an
area of low traffic or creating a denlike space or "safe zone" where she
can take herself off for some peace and quiet, has huge benefits.
Encouraging children to see the world from their dog's perspective helps
them understand and appreciate their dog's life experience. By lowering
expectations and accepting that dogs don't have to be sociable with
everyone they meet, owners can better understand how to make their dogs
feel more protected and secure. We don't necessarily want to say hello
or be friendly to everyone we encounter, so why do we expect this of our
dogs?

Allowing dogs to make autonomous decisions in certain situations
relieves pressure and allows them to be more confident.
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page79}Guiding them slowly
through situations that could otherwise be overwhelming and putting some
structure into their day creates much-needed predictability, which is
particularly beneficial for nervous dogs. Schedules are an easy way of
making a day more predictable. As a nervous dog grows in confidence,
schedules can slowly be varied until the dog is able to cope better with
novelty in everyday situations.

## Canine Emotion {.section}

There is still much debate about whether a dog's emotional experience is
similar to that of a human's or whether a dog's behavior is simply
influenced by an inner drive to survive. Although we do not yet have a
definitive scientific answer to this question, science is helping us
better understand how a dog's brain works. Scientific exploration is
producing fascinating insights into dogs' emotional world. Some believe
that although dogs have brains with the same basic structures and
functions as ours, a dog's emotional experience is negligible. But just
ask any dog owner whether their dog has emotions, and the answer is
almost always an emphatic "Of course!"

Emotions are stimulated by biology and environment, creating
physiological changes in our bodies. Falling in love with a person for
the first time increases our heart rate, makes us perspire more, and
causes butterflies in our stomach. We cry when we are sad and run away
or fight when we are frightened. These are neurological, chemical, and
hormonal changes that occur in response to environmental and situational
stimuli. Feelings, however, are how we interpret these emotional
experiences, so although we can say without a doubt that dogs do
experience emotion, we can't yet be certain exactly how they *feel*.
It's fascinating, however,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page80}to note the similarities
in the internal and outward expression of emotions in both species.

It is an undisputed fact that emotions drive behavior by informing the
brain what to do next and moving the dog (or human) toward comfort and
pleasure or away from discomfort and pain. Emotion is filtered in the
brain, and emotional significance is attached to new information by the
amygdala. Emotionally loaded experiences are stored in the long-term
memory, and the cortex or "thinking brain" applies social inhibition,
impulse control, problem solving, and learning. Another area of the
brain, the hypothalamus, regulates many of the body's functions and
prepares the body's response to environmental and situational stimuli

Behavior is guided by a dog's life experiences and influenced by
physiological processes, including the activity of neurotransmitters and
hormones. *Neurotransmitters* such as serotonin and dopamine are
electrical secretions that transmit chemical messages between neurons in
the brains and bodies of dogs and humans; *hormones* are chemical
messengers that travel through the bloodstream to the body's tissues and
organs, affecting mood, metabolism, growth, and development. Because we
share these mechanisms, humans and dogs have similar physiological
reactions to emotional states such as joy, fear, and excitement.
Serotonin, for example, has a profound effect on emotions and is
responsible for regulating mood, enhancing positive feelings, and
inhibiting aggressive responses. Dopamine helps to focus attention,
promoting states of eagerness and purpose while creating feelings of
satisfaction. A lack of these neurotransmitters causes irritability,
limited impulse control, overreactivity, anxiety, and greater
sensitivity to pain. Although these physiological reactions are similar
in both species, the way in which emotions are processed in the brain
could potentially be the key difference between the emotional experience
of the two species. Human emotions flood through a cortex that is five
times []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page81}bigger than that of
a dog, so a dog might have impressive cognitive abilities but processing
emotion may be less complex because it is unadulterated by the human
ability to analyze. Simply put, when a dog emotes, the feelings are
probably very pure and not complicated by intricate human thought.

As I mentioned previously, a dog's nose dominates her brain, which is
truly built around the information it gets from scent. Because smell is
so closely linked to emotion, there is evidence that the dog's emotional
experience might be even more intricate than we could imagine. Have you
ever smelled something that evoked a positive or negative memory? Those
memories are held with other emotionally loaded memories and can be
"released" by a sensory trigger that alters your mood. Imagine having a
dog's acute sense of smell and how intense the emotional memories and
responses evoked as a result of a sensory trigger must be.

This knowledge provides us with crucial information about how the brain
functions and how we can use the knowledge to help dogs learn and modify
emotional states such as anxiety and fear. Stimulating a dog's sense of
smell with food, for example, not only motivates a dog to learn but is
also a valuable tool for changing the way a dog's brain works (see
chapter 2, [this
page](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c02_r1.htm#ar3){.hlink}).

As mentioned, dogs trained with compulsion and force suffer higher
stress and anxiety than those trained using positive reward methods.
When a dog is punished, cortisol is released into the bloodstream and
readies the body for danger. When high levels of cortisol are released,
the brain is overwhelmed and the resulting state interferes with
rational thought. Stress from threat causes the dog to "shut down,"
effectively freezing her until the threat goes away. In this state of
anxiety the dog ceases to learn and becomes more insecure, frightened,
or angry. If she cannot practice avoidance, the only other option is to
bite, which is why so many trainers and owners who use punitive
techniques are bitten.

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page82}JEALOUSY {.section}

If dogs have similar emotional responses to humans, does that mean they
are also capable of feeling jealous? If the definition of jealousy is
"fear of rivalry; apprehension regarding the loss of another's exclusive
devotion; distrustful watchfulness; vigilance in maintaining or guarding
something,"[^14^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts14){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts14a
.hlink} doesn't that perfectly describe what dogs appear to be feeling
when they guard resources and space, monopolize an owner's attention,
and fight with their "siblings"? According to veterinary behaviorists
like Dr. Nicholas Dodman, director of animal behavior at Tufts
University, dogs can be jealous and we shouldn't get too inventive in
searching for other explanations when the obvious one is right in front
of us.

Over the years, I have had many calls from clients asking for help
because the dogs in their lives are exhibiting what seems to be jealous
or "protective" behavior toward a family member. One example was a
three-year-old male Pomeranian named Teddy Pom Pom. Teddy's owners,
Martin and Mandy, had been married for seventeen years. Martin was a
firefighter, and all he wanted after a tiring day at work was to come
home and get into bed next to his lovely wife. But Teddy Pom Pom didn't
think too highly of this intrusion and protected the bed and his
mistress as if his life depended on it, biting Martin as he slipped
under the covers. The scars on Martin's arms and legs were evidence of
the many times that Teddy had successfully defended his territory and
his mistress. Unbelievably, Mandy allowed this behavior to continue,
making all kinds of excuses for her "baby's" behavior and eventually
telling her husband to sleep in the guest room. Martin even joked that
Mandy preferred this arrangement and suspected that Teddy was being used
as the next greatest excuse to the headache: "Not tonight, dear---I have
a dog."

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page83}I work with many dogs like
Teddy Pom Pom that exhibit jealous or protective behavior by jumping
between two embracing owners. In most cases, these dogs thrive on the
attention they are given by the most important person in their life and
do not appreciate another person or animal taking that attention away
from them.

I showed Teddy that all good things came from Martin. Before entering
the home, Martin picked up Teddy's favorite treats and toys that had
been left outside the front door and gave them to him when he walked in.
Martin did this each time he came home from work until Teddy finally
made the association and began eagerly awaiting his return. When Martin
left the house, so did Teddy's treats and toys, but they magically
reappeared each time Martin came home.

Because Teddy behaved so badly in the bedroom, Mandy denied Teddy access
to the bed (and to her) whenever he showed any signs of aggressive
response. If Teddy so much as growled, he was placed on the floor and
ignored. After ten seconds of calm, he was allowed onto the bed again
and the scenario was repeated. Teddy could remain next to Mandy only if
he calmly accepted Martin's presence, and because Teddy loved being next
to her, it didn't take him long to catch on. I suspect Mandy was not as
happy as Martin to see how quickly the removal technique worked, but
even she had to admit that a contented dog and happy husband made life
much easier for them all.

Because I am always teaching biting dogs to get off beds or sofas on my
television show, I have apparently developed a false reputation as
someone who believes dogs should never be allowed on any furniture.
Actually, it's fine if your dog jumps onto the sofa or sleeps in bed
with you. The only time I have an issue with dogs in beds or on sofas is
when it results in negative or dangerous
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page84}guarding behavior (or when
a human sleeping partner is not on board with the decision to share the
bed with Fido).

If you can't get near your partner because of a jealous dog, here's how
to curb this behavior:

    • If your dog tries to get between you and your partner while you
are standing up and hugging, ignore her.

    • If she tries to jump on you while you are hugging on the sofa, you
and your partner should immediately stand up and ignore her.

    • Don't look at, talk to, or touch your dog in either scenario.

    • When she gets off the sofa, sit down again and wait for three to
five seconds.

    • If your dog keeps her four paws on the ground during that time,
praise her.

    • If she tries to jump up again during the praise, keep repeating
the exercise until she has four on the floor or goes away.

    • If your dog aggresses at your partner while being held in your
arms or sitting on your lap, immediately put your dog on the floor and
ignore.

    • Once your dog is calm, pick her up and hold her again or put her
back on your lap and repeat the exercise. Continue to place her on the
floor, without contact, if she reacts negatively, but if she accepts
your partner's closeness, praise and give her plenty of attention. Your
partner can also reward your dog's compliance with your dog's favorite
food or toy.

### GUILT {.section}

Many owners tell me they're convinced that their dogs feel guilty after
they have done something wrong. To feel guilt, however, an individual
must have a certain level of self awareness,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page85}an understanding of how
his or her behavior has affected others in the past, and a sense of how
it will affect others in the future. We are brought up in a culture that
teaches us to consciously feel guilty, ashamed, or embarrassed for
things that we have done. Although dogs do have a degree of
consciousness and are aware of the immediate consequences of their
actions, it's not known if they are truly aware of how their behavior
affects others. Because a dog's cerebral cortex is smaller than that of
a human, it is believed that dogs do not have the capacity to generate
something as complex as the self-consciousness needed to feel guilty or
ashamed.[^15^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts15){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts15a
.hlink}

When you tell your dog off for chewing something well after the act was
committed, she may slink away or use deferential body signals in an
attempt to appease your anger. Although your dog's behavior may look
"guilty," is she offering those deferential signals because she truly
feels guilt for what she has done, or is your anger causing the
response? Psychologist Alexandra Horowitz designed a study to test
whether the canine "guilty" look was really guilt (as defined in human
terms) or an expression of deferential behaviors intended to appease an
owner's anger. Horowitz asked an owner to leave her dog in a room with a
piece of food after telling the dog not to eat it. Sometimes the food
was left in view, sometimes the dog ate it, sometimes he left the food
alone, and sometimes Horowitz removed the food herself but told the
owner that her dog had eaten it. So when the food was gone, regardless
of who had taken it, the owner naturally scolded the dog. Horowitz could
thus observe that the actual guilt factor (whether or not the dog had
eaten the food) did not change the frequency of the dog's seemingly
guilty response. The dog behaved as if he were guilty, whether he had
eaten the food or not, simply in response to the owner's body language
and expression of
anger.[^16^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts16){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts16a
.hlink}

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page86}Humans are well aware of
how they think and feel and how their behavior might affect others. This
metacognition or self-awareness is linked to our reflective
consciousness and is highly sophisticated. David Smith, PhD, a
comparative psychologist at the University of Buffalo who has conducted
extensive studies in animal cognition, reports growing evidence that
animals such as dolphins and macaque monkeys share a human's ability to
reflect, monitor, and regulate their own states of
mind.[^17^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts17){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts17a
.hlink} William Roberts and his team from the University of Western
Ontario's Department of Psychology studied whether or not dogs could
detect deceit and thus determine whether a person was being helpful or
leading them astray. The study's results suggested that dogs relied
heavily on human cues, rather than metacognitive ability, to learn
whether someone was deceiving
them.[^18^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c04-nts18){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts18a
.hlink}

So in order to feel truly guilty, a dog must be mindful about the effect
her behavior will have on others and know and care what others are
thinking and feeling. Although the results of this research show that
dogs probably don't have the capacity to feel guilt, what is great for
all of us who love them is that studies like these are being
done---studies that help advance our knowledge about the way dogs think
and experience emotion.

Given the enormous advances in our understanding of what drives dogs to
do what they do, it is no longer helpful or fair to devalue and dismiss
a dog's emotional experience as being inferior to ours. Like humans,
some dogs are more emotionally expressive than others, but that doesn't
necessarily mean that if your dog is more reserved, she doesn't have the
ability to feel. Knowing how emotionally driven dogs are, is it not more
important than ever that we treat them with the respect they deserve?
Dogs' emotional well-being is influenced by early experience just as
much as ours is. Unstimulating or abusive environments, rough handling,
and hard punishment can damage emotional growth because
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#page87}stress-related pathways in
the brain are prevented from developing properly. Dogs with this kind of
early experience don't make social attachments or cope with domestic
life easily. I believe one of the reasons why humans and dogs have
formed such a special relationship with each other is our mutual ability
to express how we feel. We may not always understand each other, but at
least we're trying, and the more we discover, the better our dogs' lives
will be.

# THE POSITIVE PUPPY  [Building a Solid Foundation]{.small1} {.subchapter}

Elizabeth looked at me, bleary-eyed, while sipping a mug of hot coffee
she had just made. At her feet lay a tiny white ball of fluff. "Don't
let her fool you," she said. "The only reason she's sleeping now is
because she's been up every night since we brought her home a week ago."
Maggie, a nine-week-old Maltese puppy, was one of the cutest things I
had ever seen, but Elizabeth's demeanor told a different story. "If
someone had told me it was going to be this hard," she said, "I would
never have chosen a puppy---this is worse than having a baby."

The arrival of a new puppy is indeed a life-changing event for everyone
involved. One minute the puppy is curled up sleeping or playing with his
littermates; the next, those littermates are gone, leaving him all alone
in a new place. Some puppies adjust very quickly to a different
environment, but others take much longer to settle. The first few weeks
of life in a new home can be strange and frightening for a young dog,
and while owners are coping with the life changes that accompany the
arrival of a new []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page92}pup, the
puppy is also doing some pretty significant assimilating of his own.

I understood what Elizabeth was going through---like so many people who
bring puppies into their lives, she was having a hard time adjusting.
New parents fully expect to be kept awake at night with an infant but
for some reason when the new addition is a puppy, the little one's
nighttime needs are simply an irritant. I knew it wasn't going to be
long before Maggie slept through the night, but I also knew that
Elizabeth needed support. If she didn't get it, I feared she might do
what tens of thousands of other puppy parents do each year and
relinquish Maggie to the shelter. Elizabeth had a lot of work ahead of
her because raising a puppy properly is no easy task. Those first
developmental weeks are crucial, and I wanted to make sure that
everything possible would be done to ensure that Maggie's mental and
physical health was as sound as it could be. The next couple of weeks
would have a big impact on her future success or failure in adapting to
human domestic life.

The best time to bring a new puppy or dog into your home is when at
least one member of your family has time to spend with the puppy during
the adjustment period, which can last up to two weeks or more. It's not
advisable to get a new dog if all of the members in your family are out
of the house all day during the transition period. Conversely, I do
*not* recommend you remain beside your puppy during his every waking
moment. You can achieve a happy medium by allowing your puppy to
investigate, explore, and experience his new home, giving him plenty of
attention while also giving him the space he needs to adjust to his new
surroundings. By gradually exposing him to being away from his mother
and siblings, you will set him up to better cope when you eventually
leave him on his own for longer periods.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page93}Maggie slept in a crate in
Elizabeth's room, but because the crate was some distance from the bed,
she spent most of the night whimpering and crying for attention. The
first couple of weeks can be the loneliest for a pup, so I moved her
crate close to Elizabeth's bed and added a soft toy so that Maggie had
something to cuddle up to. Some people prefer their puppy to sleep in
bed with them, which is fine as long as the pup's nighttime toileting
needs are taken care of and all other bedmates are okay with this
arrangement. The first few weeks of nighttime potty outings were
exhausting for Elizabeth, but the sleep interruptions gradually
decreased as Maggie built up bladder control and began to sleep through
the night. Elizabeth was then able to move the crate farther from the
bed to a permanent sleeping area. The longer Maggie slept through the
night, the more active she became during the day, but like most young
puppies she still needed a lot of sleep and was allowed to take naps as
needed. Puppies are easily exhausted from taking in so much new
information.

## The Importance of Positive Socialization, Habituation, and Enrichment {.section}

Society dictates that our dogs must be well-mannered in our homes and in
public, which puts a great deal of pressure on dogs as well as owners.
It's very common for a young puppy to experience emotional changes as he
grows, but providing him with a good foundation from the beginning will
help you deal with any unforeseen challenges that may come your way. The
time you invest at the beginning of your puppy's life will allow him to
become a confident and well-adjusted adult. Most dogs cope well living
in a human world, but few people realize just how resilient a pet has to
be to conform to the rules that domestic life imposes
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page94}on them. Sadly, failure to
follow these rules results in many of them ending up in shelters.

We want our dogs to be friendly and well mannered with everyone they
meet in and out of the home, even if socializing makes them feel
uncomfortable. Although we have the freedom to choose who we want to
greet and who to avoid, our dogs almost never have that luxury. Some
people just do not understand how threatening and uncomfortable it is
for some dogs when their personal space is invaded by a stranger. Of
course, because we desire and expect our dogs to be adaptable and
emotionally stable at all times (high expectations that even we humans
can't live up to) when they react negatively to "friendly" human
interaction, they are punished for antisocial behavior.

Because puppies are not born social animals---that is, instinctively
welcoming and freely associating with humans, strange dogs, and other
animals---they have to learn to bond with others through early positive
experience. Socialization, whereby puppies and dogs are exposed to
different environments and social stimuli, is crucial in promoting
confidence. The sensitive time for socialization is approximately four
to twelve weeks of age, and puppies between the ages of eight and ten
weeks often experience what is known as the "fear period." Any negative
life experiences that occur during this period can make a lasting
impression for the rest of a dog's life.

Positive socialization teaches dogs important social skills and helps
them grow up with confidence. Overexposing a puppy, however, may have
the opposite effect---a dog that hates being touched and fears other
dogs and humans. Socializing a puppy correctly can make the difference
between an adaptable dog that copes well in various situations and one
that will never function well in society. This is one of the many
reasons why puppies bred
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page95}in puppy mills and sold
over the Internet or in pet stores tend to have so many behavioral
issues. Unfortunately, the common experience for these puppies consists
of impersonal rearing in a socially deprived environment with no
positive human interaction, followed by premature separation from the
mother and littermates and then a traumatic trip to the pet store---all
occurring during the time when good social experiences are critical.

Dr. Andrew Luescher, animal behaviorist and director of the Animal
Behavior Clinic at Purdue University, has found that deficiencies in
early development can have adverse effects on a dog's behavior and
disposition. He explains that puppies are more balanced temperament-wise
when they remain with their mothers until they are seven to eight weeks
old; puppies taken away from their mothers too soon are more likely to
be fearful, hyperactive, or even fear-aggressive (feeling fearful of a
perceived threat can lead to an aggressive response as a means of
self-defense).[^1^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c05-nts1){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05-nts1a
.hlink} This is because early and enriching experiences help the brain
develop normally. To optimize your puppy's social skills, good things
must happen when people meet him for the first time. Introductions to
other puppies and adult dogs must be made in a calm manner so as not to
overwhelm.

We took Maggie to a puppy play group where she could learn important
social skills and made sure that the other puppies in the group were
matched in size and temperament. We taught her basic learning skills and
cues at home and also practiced these cues in a class environment, so
she learned to pay attention to Elizabeth even when distracted. Some
classes won't take puppies until their vaccinations are complete, while
others take pups as young as ten weeks old---the prime time for
socialization. We monitored Maggie's interactions with the other pups to
guard against negative experiences.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page96}If you can't find an
appropriate puppy class in your area, there are other ways to give your
pup new experiences. Finding a friend for a play date or taking your
puppy on a car ride will allow him to experience an outside environment,
even if he has to be in your arms until it is safe for him to walk in
public.

A puppy tends to have a short attention span, so be sure to take regular
breaks while teaching. Even older dogs need frequent breaks to process
what they have learned, perfecting it later through repetition. Every
dog is different, so watch yours carefully: if he begins to avoid
contact with other dogs, lies down, or gets snappy at another dog's
approach, give him some time away from the situation.

As soon as Maggie came into the home, Elizabeth began to habituate her
to the various experiences she was likely to encounter in her life,
including being handled by us, the veterinarian, and the groomer. I was
careful not to bombard Maggie with constant touching by too many
strangers but allowed her to habituate gently. Touch-sensitive areas
such as the mouth, paws, tail, and belly were handled very carefully so
that Maggie wouldn't find having her teeth checked or nails trimmed
unpleasant in the future. I rewarded her acceptance and calm behavior
with praise, treats, and toys that she liked, making sure that the
rewards were only given when she was content.

Maggie was introduced to many different environmental and situational
experiences including riding in the car, meeting people, and playing at
the vet's office. The more positive interactions she had, the more
resilient her brain became and the better she coped with novel
experiences and situations. These positive experiences affect brain
growth by encouraging connections to develop between neurons in the
brain; the more varied the experience, the more the physiology of the
brain is shaped appropriately. The thicker the dog's cerebral cortex,
the higher the concentration of vital brain enzymes associated with
transmission of information
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page97}to and from various parts
of the brain will be. This not only helps a dog learn but also gives him
the ability to solve problems and control impulses in domestic
situations without being prompted. Socialization creates a more socially
acceptable
dog.[^2^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c05-nts2){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#c05-nts2a
.hlink}

Although we encouraged Maggie to follow Elizabeth around (a good
foundation for teaching the "come" cue), we also made sure there were
times when she was separated from Elizabeth in the house. Independence
training in the home teaches a puppy to cope without you when you are
away. Separation anxiety is not fun for dogs or owners and is a very
difficult condition to treat, so set your puppy up for success from the
beginning by teaching him to be emotionally secure without you. (For
more on separation anxiety, see [chapter
7](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm){.hlink}.)

## Puppy Mouthing {.section}

Pups like Maggie like to explore the world with their mouths, and
everything is a potential chew toy. Providing a safe home environment to
prevent inappropriate chewing on household items and teaching your puppy
bite inhibition from an early age will help protect him and others as he
grows. I taught Maggie that any mouthing or nipping a person's skin or
clothes stopped play and attention immediately. When she nipped at me or
Elizabeth, we got up and walked out of the room. We remained outside for
a minute and then came back to resume play and attention. If she mouthed
again, play stopped, but if she kept her teeth to herself, the game and
attention continued. We gave her toys to keep her entertained and to use
as distractions if needed, which helped redirect her mouthing to
something more appropriate. I told Elizabeth to expect a second chewing
phase when Maggie went through the first stages of adolescence between
six to nine months of age.

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page98}Building a Common Language {.section}

It's never too early to teach your puppy cues such as "sit" and "come"
that you can use to build a common language between you. A good recall
cue is vital for the safety of your puppy or dog in all environments,
and the sooner you start teaching it, the more reliable it will be. (I
will cover other valuable cues later in the book.)

### THE RECALL CUE {.section}

Most puppies will "come" to you whenever you decide to walk away because
they instinctively like to follow you. Instilling a reliable response,
however, usually takes months of consistency and positive reinforcement.
The easiest way to teach your new puppy or dog the "come" cue is to
begin using it as soon as you bring them home:

::: hanging01
    • Whenever your puppy or dog is coming to you on his own, wait until
he is a couple of feet from you and then say his name and the word
"come."

    • When he gets to you, make a big fuss over him.

    • With this exercise, your dog will learn that coming to you is a
really good thing. After a while, you can lengthen the distance between
you before you say the cue word, but be careful that you don't go too
far too soon.

    • If you want a reliable recall, do not chase your dog unless it is
an emergency. Dogs love to be chased.

    • If you call your dog a number of times and he doesn't come back to
you, don't tell him off when he eventually returns. It is understandably
annoying when your dog ignores you, but if he comes back only to find
that you're angry with him, he'll actually learn to avoid you more. He
won't understand that you're angry because he ignored you and will
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page99}think you're annoyed
because he came back. Coming to you should always be rewarded, whatever
the circumstance and no matter how long it took him to respond.

    • Motivate your dog to come by being excited, running away from him,
waving a toy, or having delicious food for him when he gets to you. This
will instill the idea that coming back to you is the best thing he can
ever do.
:::

### THE SIT CUE {.section}

Teaching your puppy or dog to "sit" gives both of you an action cue on
which to build a common language and helps to teach valuable impulse
control. This "safety" cue can be used when you need your puppy or dog
to focus his attention at specific times (for example, at the curb
before crossing the road, in front of a food bowl before eating, at the
front door when someone is coming in, and before the leash is attached).
As with any cue, teach this in short steps so that your puppy doesn't
get bored, and be aware of your pup or dog's physical comfort. Sitting
too much can be uncomfortable, especially for larger dogs.

::: hanging01
    • Hold a treat by your dog's nose and wait for him to figure out how
he is going to get it out of your hand. Some dogs will lick or paw at
it, but don't give it to him until he puts his behind on the floor.

    • Repeat this until your dog is sitting reliably, then add the word
"sit" as he is in the process of sitting so that he begins to associate
the word with the action.

    • When he is sitting repeatedly, start saying the word "sit" as you
present the treat to him, and your dog will respond.

    • Please note that if your dog is snappy or aggressive around food,
you should be very careful and substitute a toy for the
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page100}food. Using toys to teach
this instead of food is also effective if your dog is more toy
motivated.
:::

## Adolescence {.section}

Just like human kids, puppies can sometimes be difficult to handle
during adolescence, which for most dogs is around six to eighteen months
of age. A puppy that once came when called may now develop an acute case
of selective hearing, choosing to come only when he wants to. Puppy play
can turn into pushy behavior that offends other dogs, causing
disagreements and fights. Adult dogs that are normally tolerant of young
pups will suddenly show their objections to rude behavior, and the pup
that used to back down from a warning may now choose to stand his
ground. This is the time when the young dog begins to test his human
family as well as other dogs he meets, and it's why so many adolescent
dogs end up in shelters; people are put off by this change in behavior.

Bearing this change in mind, early learning is even more important and
provides a solid foundation so that when adolescence rears its sometimes
ugly head, communication is clear and boundaries have been set. You may
find that you have to put in extra time with your dog and watch his
interactions with others a lot more closely so that you can stop a
situation before it gets out of hand. In adolescence, dogs tend to be
more fearful or shy than they were as puppies. It amazes me how closely
these behavioral phases mirror what we humans experience, except that,
thanks to dog years, theirs seems to come much earlier. Adolescence
doesn't last long, but many people are greatly relieved when this phase
of a dog's life is over.

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page101}General Puppy-Teaching Tips {.section}

::: hanging01
    • Start teaching in an environment free from distractions, such as a
quiet room in your home, before teaching outside in your yard or in the
park. Puppies and adult dogs learn faster when there is less around to
distract them. Once your puppy is responding well in one environment,
gradually introduce him to others. Don't always teach in the same place.
Use all the rooms in your home as well as your yard, street, car, and
local park. This ensures that your puppy learns to respond in varied
environments and not just in one place.

    • When teaching a new cue, keep sessions short to prevent boredom.

    • Three five-to-ten-minute teaching sessions a day are recommended
for teaching new cues, but communication and behavioral exercises should
be rehearsed throughout daily life.

    • Tired pups don't learn. Remember that mental activity can be more
exhausting than physical activity.

    • Use a mixture of vocal and physical communication.

    • Vary the position of your body and distance while teaching action
cues such as "sit" and "stay."

    • Teaching should be as fun as playing. Puppies get bored easily, so
be energetic and interesting.

    • Be consistent---pups love predictability.

    • Be patient and don't be afraid of failure.

    • Reinforce good behavior throughout your dog's life.

    • Try to prevent emotional highs and lows.

    • Never use punishment or try to dominate your puppy or dog. This
will damage the relationship between you and exacerbate aggressive
response.

    • Make it easy for your pup to do well.

    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c05_r1.htm#page102}Enrich your pup's
environment to avoid sensory deprivation. Provide plenty of
puppy-appropriate toys to play with.

    • All sessions should end on a good note with plenty of praise.

If you need help teaching your puppy or dog and are unsure how to deal
with a problem behavior, hire a trainer to help you. Avoid trainers that
recommend choke, prong, or shock collars, and make sure that your
trainer uses humane positive reinforcement methods only. (To find a

# HOUSETRAINING HELL  [Solving Toileting Issues]{.small1} {.subchapter}

Roxy and Rio were eight-month-old Greyhound sisters that had the worst
toileting issues I had ever seen. They belonged to a young couple who
had never raised puppies before and thought that over time their dogs
would learn to toilet outside by themselves and the messing in the home
would stop. Six months later, the couple was still cleaning up mounds of
poop and puddles of urine three times a day, every day. The smell of
urine overwhelmed me as I entered the dogs' main toileting area. Roxy
and Rio were charming, happy dogs, but as they came to greet me and
jumped up to say hello, I felt a warm splash of urine on my face. This
was going to be a long day.

## Successful Housetraining {.section}

Toileting "accidents" are some of the most common issues I encounter,
driving owners to the point of insanity and dogs into confinement.
Usually this issue is resolved relatively quickly by helping a young pup
learn how to eliminate appropriately, but
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c06_r1.htm#page104}occasionally older dogs
develop behavior issues that negatively affect their ability to potty
properly. Toileting is obviously a necessary act that removes harmful
waste from the body, but the number of dogs that are given up by their
families and surrendered to rescue shelters because of toileting
problems is far too high.

Having gone through the process of housetraining Jasmine when she was a
puppy (see [chapter 10](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm){.hlink}), I
realize how fixated I became on her toileting habits. Elimination is
closely linked to physical and emotional health. When a previously
housetrained dog begins to toilet inappropriately, I always begin with
an investigation into the dog's physical condition.

Successful housetraining is one of the first things the owner of a new
puppy or dog needs to accomplish, and even though the learning process
can be time consuming, it doesn't have to be daunting. By employing a
combination of consistency, common sense, and positive reinforcement
protocols, you can quickly train any dog to toilet appropriately.
Housetraining is also an invaluable building block that helps dogs and
people better understand one another while developing a personalized
communication process. This understanding creates a strong bond based on
mutual trust and respect, ensuring both parties enjoy a healthy
relationship.

## Toilet Training: Getting Started {.section}

Before starting the housetraining process, understand that from the
perspective of new puppies or untrained dogs, there is no good reason in
their minds why they should not toilet inside the home. It is up to
people to give their dogs the tools they need to succeed in a domestic
world, and that starts with helping them learn where it is appropriate
to toilet. There are a number of ways to toilet train a dog
successfully; your choice really depends on the type of environment you
live in. People in urban living
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c06_r1.htm#page105}situations with no yard
tend to paper train their puppies until the pups have had all their
vaccinations at approximately sixteen weeks old. When it is safe for the
puppy to be outside, they make the transition between paper training
inside and toileting outside. In contrast, those in suburban or rural
environments with yards or a safe outside area might use a combination
of training pads and outside toileting, while others skip pads
altogether and take their pups straight outside.

### PAPER-TRAINING GUIDELINES {.section}

::: hanging01
    • Create a "safe zone" area where the puppy can be confined when
unsupervised. This can be either a pen or a small puppy-proofed room
with the pup's bed or crate, food, and water bowl.

    • Line the entire area with training pads. At first the puppy will
toilet all over the place, but this way it will always be on a pad.

    • Remove soiled pads frequently.

    • Reduce the number of pads by taking away one pad every few days,
leaving a small area without a pad. Because the puppy has built up a
habit of toileting on the pads, she should naturally gravitate to the
area where the pads are still covering the floor, leaving the unpadded
area clean.

    • Puppies instinctively do not like to toilet too near where they
eat or sleep, so ensure that the first pads you remove are the ones
closest to the pup's bed and bowls.

    • Over the next few weeks, gradually reduce the toileting area by
removing each pad until there is one single pad left. Ensure that the
remaining pad is the farthest from pup's bed and bowl, and change any
soiled pads regularly.

    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c06_r1.htm#page106}Use a cue word ("go
potty," for example) that the puppy will associate with toileting, and
quietly say that word while she is in the act of toileting. When she has
finished, gently praise her and/or give her a favorite treat or toy as a
reward. Repeating this process consistently will build up an association
between the word and the act of toileting so that you can use the word
to encourage the puppy to toilet.

    • If the puppy is making the transition from toileting on pads
inside to going outside, take a partially soiled pad to an appropriate
outside area and place it on the ground. This will encourage the puppy
to toilet outside while still having the comforting feel of the pad
underneath her paws.

    • Once the puppy is confident about going outside, remove the use of
indoor pads completely.

    • If you want to designate a permanent toileting area in your home,
make sure you choose a quiet area. As you give your puppy more freedom,
encourage her to use the pad by leading her to this area at hourly
intervals and then less frequently as she learns to hold herself for
longer periods.

    • The puppy should now be at the stage where she is taking herself
to her pad to toilet.
:::

Be especially vigilant and prepared for a dog to eliminate at the
following times:

::: hanging01
    • Immediately after meals

    • After training sessions

    • Shortly after waking

    • After vigorous play

    • During or after a stressful event

    • When overly excited
:::

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c06_r1.htm#page107}WHAT *NOT* TO DO {.section}

Never scold a dog for toileting inappropriately, and never rub her nose
in or near her mess. Contrary to popular opinion, a puppy or dog does
not toilet inappropriately out of spite. If you catch your puppy or dog
in the act of toileting in the home, issue a gentle vocal interrupter (I
use "uh-oh") and pick her bottom off the ground. Remove her to the pad
or outside and encourage her to toilet in that area. If a puppy is
punished for toileting, the punisher becomes someone to be feared, and
the pup will then be inclined to either toilet in secret or hold herself
until the person is out of sight. This does not bode well for those who
want their dogs to toilet when out on a walk! Leaving poorly
housetrained puppies or dogs in the home unsupervised sets them up to
fail unless they are in a "safe area."

### THE ROLE OF THE CRATE {.section}

Crate training is a popular way of encouraging puppies to hold
themselves for longer periods of time and of keeping them safe when
unsupervised. Used correctly, a crate encloses a puppy safely and
becomes a favorite place for sleeping and/or quiet time. But keeping a
puppy or a dog in a crate for too long can also inadvertently encourage
the dog to toilet where she sleeps, increasing the potential for anxiety
problems to develop. If you use the crate correctly, it can be a highly
effective toilet training tool as well as a comfortable den.

Some puppies love their crates; others need a bit of time to acclimate.
When we first brought our nervy little rescue pup, Jasmine, home with
us, she took to her crate almost immediately, most likely because she
recognized it as a safe, quiet place in her strange new house. When I
introduce a puppy to the crate, I make it comfortable with bedding and
safe toys and leave the door open so that the puppy can investigate,
while encouraging her to go in
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c06_r1.htm#page108}by throwing a favorite
treat or chew inside. If the puppy decides to settle, I allow her to do
so without closing the door so that she can make her own decision about
whether to stay or leave. Once she is comfortable in the crate, I begin
closing the door for a few seconds at a time, gradually building up the
duration as long she is relaxed.

At this stage I like to give the puppy a durable rubber chew toy with
some food inside so that she has the pleasure of chewing and eating
while she is in the crate. Then I gradually increase the distance
between myself and the crate until I can go about my own business while
the puppy is settled. This process can take a few hours to a few days,
but it's important not to rush. If the puppy begins to whine or bark, I
wait until she is quiet before opening the door to let her out.

Each time puppy goes into her crate, I pair that decision with a cue
such as "go to bed." This builds up an association between the cue and
the action of walking into the crate so that she knows what to do when
she hears those words in the future. Building up a positive association
with puppy's crate means I can travel with my pup more successfully.
This whole process can be used to help adult dogs acclimate to a crate
too, but remember that some dogs do not adjust well to being confined in
this way and do better in a pen or a safe room in your home.

### TOILET-TRAINING SCHEDULES {.section}

As with most teaching, successful toilet training depends on consistency
and repetition. Creating a recurring schedule that everyone in your
household follows is crucial to helping your dog learn what is
appropriate and what is not. Here is a typical schedule that I use to
toilet train puppies; this is only a general guide and can be changed to
fit specific needs.

::: block
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c06_r1.htm#page109}**8 a.m.:** Take the
puppy out to toilet as soon as you wake up.

**8:30 a.m.:** Feed the puppy the first meal of the day. Leave the food
down for twenty minutes; after that time, pick up any that remains. Take
the puppy outside immediately after eating and give her time to toilet
again.

**9 a.m.:** Puppy can now have supervised free time in the home as long
as she has toileted.

**9:30 a.m.:** Take the puppy to her crate or the "safe zone" for an
unsupervised nap or some play time.

**10:30 a.m.:** Take the puppy out to toilet again.

**Noon:** If the puppy is eating three meals a day, feed her at this
time. When she is six months old you can reduce feeding to twice a day.
Leave the food down for twenty minutes and pick up what is left. Take
her out to toilet immediately after feeding.

**12:30--2:30 p.m.:** Puppy goes into her crate or to the safe zone for
a nap, play, or chew time.

**2:30 p.m.:** Take the puppy out to toilet.

**3 to 5 p.m.:** Give the puppy half an hour of full supervised home
access only after she has toileted and follow that with unsupervised
time in the crate or safe zone.

**5 p.m.:** Give the puppy the last daily feeding. Leave the food down
for twenty minutes and remove any food that remains. Take puppy out
immediately after feeding to toilet.

**6 p.m. till bedtime:** Use a mixture of crate and safe zone time,
supervised free time in the home, and/or access to outside for toilet
breaks.
:::

As your puppy grows, you will find that you don't need to take her out
as often. As a general rule, puppies at rest can hold themselves for up
to one hour for every month of age. Vigorous play or other stimulation
can reduce this time. Crate time can happen throughout the day, but it
shouldn't last longer than your puppy
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c06_r1.htm#page110}can cope with, which will
depend on your puppy's age and the progress she is making. Keeping a pup
in a crate for too long causes accidents, inappropriate chewing, and
anxiety.

I used all of the preceding protocols with Roxy and Rio, and within two
weeks of my visit there had been significant improvement. After six
weeks with no accidents in the home, their exhausted but happy owners
finally declared their dogs housetrained.

## Toileting Issues {.section}

One of the most irritating behaviors that dog owners complain about is
that even if their dogs seem to be well housetrained, they still urinate
inside. In some cases this elimination is attributed to dogs' desire to
mark territory; in others, urination and defecation are seen as an
expression of anxiety or an inability to hold themselves when excited.

### SCENT MARKING {.section}

Joel and Eileen had two female and two male Chihuahuas with a serious
scent-marking problem that had rotted the wooden floors in the dining
room where the dogs spent most of their time. The entire house smelled
of urine. By the time I arrived, the couple had effectively given up,
noting that while stopping one dog from scent marking was a tough task,
stopping all four seemed to be impossible. The dogs had ample
opportunity to go outside, but competition among the four meant that as
far as they were concerned their food, bedding, chair legs, and other
objects existed merely to be marked on a daily basis. The situation had
become desperate for the family, but the solutions were actually quite
simple and easily workable.

Scent marking is a very normal and common behavior (particularly in male
dogs), but it becomes a big problem when marking
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c06_r1.htm#page111}occurs in the home. As
mentioned in chapter 4, dogs mark to advertise their presence or to
claim territory and resources. Pheromones in urine and feces play a
large part in canine communication, containing chemical messages that
pass along valuable information about the marker, such as age, sex,
health, and reproductive status. These pheromones are concentrated in
the moist areas of a dog's body, including the anogenital region, the
ears, and the mouth. Glands are also contained within every hair
follicle on a dog's body. Urination has a competitive component but can
also occur if a dog is overstimulated during or after vigorous play, or
if a dog becomes anxious in a particular situation (such as when a
person leaves). This common expression of anxiety is often mistaken for
spite, resulting in punishment, which only increases the behavior.

Both sexes scent mark, but unneutered males are the worst offenders
because the presence of testosterone stimulates signaling of sexual
availability and claiming of territory. In many cases, neutering can
significantly reduce the desire to scent mark, but some dogs continue
even after they have been "fixed." Resources such as toys, food bowls,
chew treats, bones, and beds are the most likely objects to be marked,
and in some cases a dog will actually mark a person or something that
smells heavily of that person, such as a sofa or bed. Scent marking is
usually more common in multidog households where dogs compete for space,
resources, and human attention.

Although this can be a difficult behavior to work with, scent marking
can be tackled successfully by taking the following steps:

::: hanging01
    • Remove high-value resources such as bones and food bowls that
encourage competitive marking.

    • Do not allow the dog or dogs that scent mark to roam freely around
the home.

    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c06_r1.htm#page112}To prevent access
to favorite marking spots during times when you are unable to actively
supervise your dogs, confine them to a dog-proofed room or crate.

    • Avoid competitive or vigorous play indoors, as excess activity
encourages urination.

    • If a dog is about to mark, interrupt the behavior with a vocal
interrupter and immediately direct the dog to something more positive or
take her outside.

    • Help a marking dog succeed by taking her to new and different
areas on walks. This will encourage her to mark outside rather than in
the home, but take care not to allow your dog to toilet in neighbors'
yards and please be considerate by picking up any poop!
:::

The four Chihuahuas' desire to scent mark was eliminated by using the
methods listed. I often find that boredom and lack of mental stimulation
and physical exercise exacerbates marking behavior, so a daily schedule
of activities that kept the dogs occupied, along with good environmental
management, was the perfect prescription for happier dogs and a cleaner
household.

### EXCITABLE OR SUBMISSIVE URINATION {.section}

Dogs that urinate when excited or nervous should never be scolded.
Elimination can be an expression of anxiety, and punishment only makes
this issue worse. In these cases, each new person who comes into the
home must give limited attention to the dog until she is calm. When
attention is finally given, the person should resist approaching the dog
and allow her to make her own decision whether she wants to greet,
relieving social pressure and curbing the need to release urine from
stress.

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c06_r1.htm#page113}HOUSETRAINING OLDER DOGS {.section}

Teaching older dogs that have not previously been taught to toilet
appropriately can also be a challenge. Most dogs raised in a normal
domestic environment respond well to a good housetraining schedule, but
those that have lived in puppy mills are notoriously difficult to teach.
Dogs prefer not to toilet where they sleep and eat, but because of
cramped conditions, puppy-mill dogs are forced to do just that.
Transitioning from a puppy mill into a home can therefore be problematic
and makes crate training---usually a successfully way to toilet train a
dog---much less effective. However, even puppy mill dogs can be taught
to toilet appropriately with a good schedule that goes back to basics,
allowing access to outside areas every hour, encouraging the dog to
toilet with a verbal cue, and then gradually decreasing the frequency of
trips as the dog builds up control. Following a schedule builds up a
ritual of behavior that eventually becomes predictable and reliable.
Human patience and sensitivity is the key to success, especially when
dealing with dogs with compromised backgrounds like puppy-mill
survivors.

There is no doubt that housetraining issues cause a great deal of
distress for owners and their dogs, but any toileting issue can be
solved relatively quickly with patience and understanding. Toileting is
closely linked to physical and mental health, so if you are concerned
about your dog's toileting habits, pay a visit to your veterinarian, who
can rule out any medical issues your dog may have before you start on a
schedule or modification plan.

# HOME-ALONE BLUES  [Easing Separation Distress and Anxiety]{.small1} {.subchapter}

Dogs and humans have a natural, mutual need to form social
attachments---a need that results in our rare and shared ability to
develop close relationships with species other than our own. Most dogs
thrive in social groups, forming strong bonds with the families with
which they live. Although some dogs may not particularly like being left
alone, most learn to cope with their owner's absence. Some dogs,
however, become so distressed when their families leave that they
experience the canine version of a panic attack, resulting in excessive
vocalization, pacing, whining, panting, inappropriate toileting, and
destructiveness. These dogs are desperate to reestablish contact with
their owners. I have worked on cases where dogs have jumped out of
windows or chewed through doors in a desperate attempt to find their
families, causing major destruction and injury to both their homes and
themselves. It's not only upsetting for the families whose dogs suffer
such distress but also endlessly exasperating for them to return to a
half-eaten wall or a broken window.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page116}Dogs that suffer from
separation distress and anxiety are often hypervigilant even when their
owners are home, following them from room to room and growing
increasingly anxious when the time comes for them to leave. Some of
these behaviors can be relatively mild to begin with, but in my
experience, if ignored at this stage, these issues can easily escalate
into a more serious anxiety-related condition. Separation distress and
anxiety has many causes, but genetics, trauma, removing pups from their
mother and littermates too soon (before seven weeks), and an early
history of abandonment can contribute to what quickly becomes a deeply
rooted problem that is highly resistant to change. Any breed of dog can
develop this debilitating condition at any age, and its sudden onset in
older dogs suggests that this anxiety is also linked to cognitive
decline.

It seems that the number of separation anxiety cases is on the rise,
probably due largely to societal changes in domestic situations. As more
people leave the house to work elsewhere, animals are spending longer
hours at home by themselves with nothing to do. Some dogs spend their
whole lives waiting for their people to come home, with few
opportunities to socialize or any outlets to relieve their boredom and
anxiety throughout the day. These dogs feel a desperate relief when
their owners come home and a rising panic when they leave again. The
resulting physical and material destruction is hard to come home to,
which is why so many dogs with separation issues unfortunately end up in
shelters.

## Boredom Equals Mischief {.section}

Coming home to a mangled sofa or half-eaten wall does not necessarily
mean your dog is suffering from separation distress. In many cases this
destruction is simply the result of boredom. When clients tell me their
dogs have separation problems, I'm always careful to
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page117}first establish whether
the issues their dogs have are anxiety-based because making assumptions
about behavior without concrete evidence can mean a lot of wasted time
and energy dealing with a problem that doesn't really exist.

Hoss, a four-year-old rescued male Weimaraner, had previously been
"rehomed" many times due to his destructive behavior. He was a strong,
powerful dog capable of doing great damage if not crated during his
owner's absence, and his chosen area of destruction in his new home was
mainly centered in the kitchen and by the front door. Neighbors reported
barking coming from inside the house when the owners were away. As a
result, Hoss and the three dogs he lived with were never left by
themselves for fear of the damage they would do.

I wanted to get an accurate picture of Hoss's behavior so I could see
for myself whether the destruction was indeed a result of the distress
his family thought he was experiencing when they left him. To do this, I
set up video cameras in areas of the home where the destruction was
historically the worst and then left the house with the family. When we
returned an hour later, the home looked like it had been hit by a
tornado, but the dogs themselves acted as if nothing had happened.
Little did Hoss know that we had been spying on his every move.

I love watching what dogs do when they are home alone, and Hoss's antics
were particularly entertaining. The big Weimaraner stood by the front
door, waiting for us to get into the car and pull out of the driveway.
Once he was satisfied we had gone, he walked into the kitchen. With one
paw he opened a drawer and investigated the contents inside, pulling out
a couple of kitchen towels and taking them off into the sitting room
where the other dogs were patiently waiting. After some fun chew time,
Hoss casually sauntered back into the kitchen and, resting one paw on
the top of the kitchen counter, used the other to open the top cabinet.
In one []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page118}swift motion he
knocked a jar of peanut butter out of the cabinet and onto the counter,
took it into his mouth, and carried it off into the sitting room. The
other dogs in the household, having grown tired of chewing on boring
kitchen towels, took advantage of the opened drawer and removed other
bits and pieces to play with. Only ten minutes had passed, and the house
already looked like there had been a burglary. Hoss then proceeded to
chew through the plastic peanut butter jar and eat the contents. After
his feast, he walked around to see whether there was anything else to
steal before contentedly wandering to his bed to fall asleep. Back in
the living room, the other dogs were still chewing on various kitchen
utensils, while a new dog the family was fostering paced up and down by
the front door, barking. Half an hour later, all the dogs---having
enjoyed themselves immensely---fell asleep and remained that way until
we returned.

Destruction that occurs when dogs are by themselves can indeed be
attributed to separation distress, especially when focused on exit
points such as doors and windows, but it was very clear from the video
footage I filmed over several days that even though Hoss may have
suffered from separation-related issues in the past, living in a home
with other dogs had turned anxiety into mischief. Boredom and lack of
appropriate physical exercise and mental stimulation was the cause of
Hoss's destructive behavior. Weimaraners are an energetic breed, so with
no outlet to release his energy, Hoss had decided to use his excellent
problem-solving and hunting skills to find jars of peanut butter, which
made his owners' absences very appealing. I could almost see the gleam
in his eye when he saw we were leaving.

I recommended that the family exercise their dogs daily, including
playing retrieval games in the backyard. It's very important to give
certain breeds an opportunity to do what they were bred to do: pointing,
flushing, and retrieving duck-scented
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page119}dummies gave Hoss an
engaging new outlet to channel his physical and mental energy. He was
given further mental stimulation by learning new action cues that
centered on impulse control and problem solving, such as "sit," "stay,"
"wait," and "leave it." I advised the family manage their environment
and block access to the kitchen area when the dogs were alone as well as
provide them with appropriate activity toys to play with. These small
changes made a world of difference in all the dogs' lives, and Hoss
never felt the need to steal again.

## Exercise and Environmental Enrichment {.section}

The world is full of unemployed dogs! Enriching your dog's life
experience reduces boredom, anxiety, and other behavioral issues that
can arise when he might otherwise have nothing to do.

Taking your dog on at least one long daily walk is essential for his
physical and mental health. Exercise is a potent stress reliever for all
animals, so a good walk not only exercises a dog physically but also
provides a different environment to challenge and stimulate his senses.
Unlike feral dogs, the domesticated dog lives in a sensory-deprived
environment, which in many cases causes big problems. A regular walk
schedule will enhance your dog's life immeasurably by increasing levels
of serotonin, which plays an important role in lowering stress and
controlling undesirable impulsive behavior. Inactivity contributes to
destructive behaviors such as chewing, inappropriate toileting,
excessive barking, and other anxiety-based behaviors such as separation
anxiety and aggression. Dogs that are regularly left alone for long
hours shouldn't be blamed for taking out their boredom and loneliness on
the couch. Chewing gives a dog something to do and triggers the release
of pleasurable endorphins into the body,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page120}which modulates stress
and gives the dog a feeling of comfort and well-being.

I am constantly surprised by clients who complain about their dogs'
destructive behavior yet fail to give them regular exercise. It's an
alien concept to me, because personally I don't feel right each day
until I've taken my dogs out for a good long walk. I make time for them
even if my schedule is busy, because not doing so prevents them from
doing what dogs are really good at---scenting, investigating,
socializing, and having some well-earned freedom.

A former client of mine bred and showed Maltese---beautiful dogs with
gleaming coats as white as snow and as soft as the finest down. She
lived in the countryside, surrounded by fields. What an idyllic and
peaceful setting it was---until I got inside the house. Maltese are
known to have particularly fine voices, and all five of her dogs barked
continually throughout the day. One of the first questions I ask any
owner is how much exercise their dogs receive. My client replied that
she didn't walk her dogs because they were show dogs and she didn't want
their coats to split or become matted. I'm not often rendered
speechless, but in this instance I could do nothing but stand and stare
at her. How could an experienced dog owner not understand that her dogs
were barking because they were bored and stressed from lack of physical
exercise and mental stimulation? Despite my advice to meet her dogs'
needs, the woman continued to keep them in pent-up torment, all because
she enjoyed winning dog shows. I was appalled.

Enriching your dog's life doesn't need to take up a lot of time. It just
means a different approach: a new awareness of your dog's needs and a
few small life changes. Walking is good for people too, so sharing the
responsibility with the whole family ensures that your dog receives the
attention and time he deserves and everyone stays fit. A tired dog is a
happy dog!

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page121}QUICK TIPS TO PREVENT BOREDOM {.section}

Here are some great ways to keep your dog physically and mentally
enriched:

::: hanging01
    • Stimulate your dog's senses by allowing him to experience
different environments each day. Introduce new smells, sights, sounds,
tastes, and textures in your home, around the neighborhood, or at your
local park.

    • If your dog spends long hours at home by himself during the day,
consider hiring a dog walker or take your dog to a reputable doggy day
care. Leaving your dog in the yard all day without taking him for a walk
is as bad as leaving him in the house---the "backyard barker" is an all
too familiar sound.

    • If your dog loves the car, take him for a ride. This provides
great visual stimulation and that "wind in the face" thrill.

    • Play games with your dog, such as hide-and-seek, fetch, football,
Frisbee, and tug-of-war. Hide treats around the house and activate your
dog's "seeker system" by sending him on a treasure hunt. Vary your dog's
toys by rotating them each day; buy toys that challenge his brain, such
as a durable rubber toy, treat ball, or puzzle.

    • Teach your dog new action cues, such as "sit," "lie down,"
"touch," "go to bed," "wait," and "come," to provide valuable mental
stimulation. There are many examples of great action cues you can teach
throughout this book.

    • Find an agility class in your area and get together with other
owners and their dogs. Agility is a sport where dogs learn to go over a
number of obstacles in varying sequences. It is the perfect sport to
challenge your dog mentally and physically while encouraging both of you
to work as a team. Not only is it beautiful to watch, but mastering new
moves provides a
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page122}much-needed confidence
boost, especially for dogs that have insecurity or anxiety issues.

    • Organize a regular dog-walking group or set up canine play dates.
Playing helps a dog rehearse his social skills and keeps him active.

    • Sports such as Canine Freestyle and Rally Obedience teach your dog
to be in tune with your every movement while developing great
communication skills and creating a stronger bond between you.

    • Cater to your dog's needs by allowing his breed or mix of breeds
to dictate what he may enjoy doing. If your dog is predisposed to
tracking, hunting, luring, or herding, there are many organizations you
can join throughout the country that practice these specific sports in
controlled environments.

    • If your dog likes to be touched, give him a massage. This is a
good way to relax and increases the bond between you.

    • Therapy work can be great for the confident, social dog. These
dogs love visiting the elderly and people in hospitals or schools
because they thrive on human attention.

    • Minimize destruction by managing your dog's environment, and set
him up for success by providing him with a safe area where he can go
when unsupervised.

## The Ultimate Separation Distress and Anxiety Treatment Plan {.section}

As I've discussed, dogs that suffer from separation issues can create
anything from minor to major destruction when left alone. This
destruction is focused not only on points of entry, but also in places
and with objects that are more intimately associated
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page123}with an owner, such as
shoes, beds, or sofas. Chewing eases frustration and promotes a feeling
of calm for a dog---just as some humans relieve tension by biting their
nails. Some dogs will chew on themselves or household objects; others
may develop displacement/obsessive type behaviors such as repeated
pacing, spinning, or licking.

Bob, a cute little Boston Terrier, belonged to Shirley, a young lawyer
who spent many hours working away from home. The Boston Terrier is known
to be a lively breed; Bob was a firework waiting to explode. Shirley
told me how much he liked to suck on blankets and bath towels, nibbling
off the labels perfectly without harming the rest of the material.
Strangely, Shirley kept Bob's detached labels in a bag as souvenirs of
his delicate work. There were hundreds of them!

The real problem arose, however, whenever Shirley left for work in the
morning. As soon as she started putting on her make-up, Bob would pace
up and down the apartment, salivating profusely. Putting on make-up was
the beginning of Shirley's "departure ritual" and the first in a long
line of triggers that told Bob she was leaving him. By the time Shirley
left the apartment, Bob was in a state of panic. Neighbors reported that
he barked for half an hour after Shirley had left and in spurts
throughout the day. By the time Shirley came back nine hours later, Bob
was beside himself with excitement, jumping and nibbling at her as she
struggled to get through the door. By then the apartment was in a state
of utter disarray. Pillows and sofas had been chewed, walls gnawed, and
the front door scratched. Urine and feces were everywhere. Shirley and
Bob needed help.

The choice of a management protocol for the treatment of separation
distress and anxiety depends on the severity of the disorder, which must
be tackled on many levels. First and foremost,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page124}anxious dogs require
appropriate daily exercise to lessen their anxiety and increase their
ability to cope, being particularly effective if done just before an
owner's departure. Shirley needed to get up a little earlier in the
mornings and give Bob good aerobic exercise rather than the usual
ten-minute pee-and-poop walk. This daily exercise was complemented with
an active training program that allowed Bob to learn new action cues
centered on impulse control and problem solving, designed to stimulate
the learning part of his brain and ease his frustration.

Even though Shirley was flattered that Bob followed her everywhere and
adored the ground she walked on, indulging this habit did not help him,
so she focused on developing a more balanced, less dependent
relationship while she was at home. If she needed to use the bathroom,
she was to go in and close the door, leaving Bob outside. At times she
would take herself off to her bedroom and shut the door so that Bob was
left in the living room, sometimes with a toy to work on. This
separation in the home was new to him and took some getting used to, but
after a few days, he became less bothered when he was left in a room by
himself.

It was much easier for Bob to cope with Shirley's departure if she
didn't make a fuss over him when she was leaving. The same was true when
she returned, so we worked on making Shirley's entrances and exits no
big deal. She was to say a soft "good-bye" when she left and a quiet
"hello" when she returned and then go about her business until Bob was
calm so that they could relax together. Bob was also very sensitive to
changes in his environment, so the transition from the energy when
Shirley was present to the silence in the home when she left was
profound. I asked her to start leaving lights on and playing music in
the apartment when she was away.

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page125}DESENSITIZATION TO DEPARTURE TRIGGERS {.section}

Desensitizing dogs to departure triggers is an important part of any
good behavior modification plan, as some dogs become anxious as soon as
they see their owners picking up keys and putting on coats. Masking
these triggers by hiding coats, putting keys in a different place, and
using a different handbag can help, but dogs quickly become wise to our
human tricks, and an owner's departure energy is difficult to hide.
However, putting on a coat and exiting the home followed immediately by
a return allows a dog to see the trigger in a different light. The dog
learns that the act of putting on a coat does not necessarily signal an
owner is going to leave for a long period of time. Constant repetition
over a number of days helps desensitize the dog until departures no
longer trigger a response. Time spent away is gradually increased until
the dog is confident that the owner will always return.

Shirley started by putting on her coat, walking out the door for a few
seconds, returning, removing her coat, and sitting down. She repeated
this many times, gradually getting to one minute and then building up to
five minutes by the end of our session. By the twentieth departure, Bob
began to lose interest in what Shirley was doing. The first thirty
minutes after an owner's departure can be the worst for a dog that
suffers from separation problems, so building up the time slowly was
critical, and Bob's response was exactly what we wanted to see. Shirley
and I were exhausted, but Bob was quiet and had taken himself off to his
bed. Breakthrough!

### SOUND THERAPY {.section}

Sound therapy is a form of *sensory education* that is a new and
exciting addition to any behavior modification protocol dealing with
anxiety or stress issues in dogs. I have long used music to aid the
relaxation process, and I had always wanted to find a way of combining
music with certain behavior modification techniques
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page126}to create an even more
powerful and effective way to ease anxieties and phobias in dogs. I have
seen the profound effect that the specially designed psychoacoustic
music of Through a Dog's Ear has on calming dogs in homes and shelters
around the world, but I wanted to go a step further by combining this
music with a behavior modification plan to help calm a dog's nervous
system. So I teamed up with the founders of Through a Dog's Ear: concert
pianist Lisa Spector and Joshua Leeds, a noted sound researcher who has
studied the effect of music and sound on the human and canine nervous
system. Leeds explains that auditory cognition in humans is complex but,
"when exposed to music, the human brain methodically analyzes every
interval, rhythmic nuance, instrumental density, and melodic turn." His
innovative research found that many of the same auditory cues also
affect canines. For many years, Leeds and Spector tested their
groundbreaking music on dogs in all kind of situations and in many
different environments, discovering that dogs showed a preference for
slow, simple classical music played on a solo piano at a low
frequency.[^1^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c07-nts1){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts1a
.hlink}

To begin the process of habituating Bob to the music, I advised that
Shirley find a time when she and Bob could either relax together or
engage in a low-energy activity that he enjoyed while playing the
*Calming* CD from the Canine Noise Phobia Series (which I developed in
partnership with Through a Dog's Ear; see
[Resources](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_res_r1.htm){.hlink}). Pairing the
music with activities that Bob enjoyed helped him relax and built up a
positive association with the music being played. This association was
"charged" over a period of days by repeating the music at intervals
during periods of calm. Once a positive association with the music had
been made and Shirley could be away from home for five minutes without
Bob panicking, she then turned on the music as soon as she walked back
into the apartment. This protocol was designed so that Bob would not
only associate the music with good things but also recognize that the
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page127}music signaled her return
as well. Repeating this process ensured that he now recognized her
"arrival" music, which could then be played *before* she was about to
leave and during the first forty-five minutes after she left. So that
the music never became a precursor cue to Shirley's leaving, she also
continued to play it at intervals when she was at home.

### THE HEALING POWER OF TOYS AND FOOD {.section}

Leaving a dog with appropriate activity toys on which to chew is a
crucial element of managing separation distress. Some dogs are too
anxious to eat or play with a toy when their owner is absent, so it's
important to introduce the dog's favorite toys and/or chews while the
owner is present, building up a positive feeling around that particular
toy. This toy is then given to the dog a few minutes before the owner
departs, in the hope that the dog will be more focused on the toy than
on the owner's departure. Interactive toys such as stuffed rubber bones
or treat balls can also help refocus the mind, encouraging the dog to
release anxious energy on an appropriate item rather than the sofa.
Initially, Bob couldn't eat or play with anything when Shirley was away,
but by providing a positive association with the toys while she was
present, Shirley helped him gradually enjoy them while she was gone.

Despite good progress from the institution of these management
protocols, Shirley's schedule of nine hours a day, five days a week was
still a problem. It was a long time to leave Bob by himself. Dogs don't
do well in social isolation, so we had to do something to break up the
monotony of his day. Luckily Shirley was in a position to invest in a
dog walker three times a week, and twice a week Bob went to doggy day
care, which he loved. Bob's behavior improved immeasurably, and Shirley
could finally feel confident that she was coming home to a happier
dog---and an intact apartment.

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page128}WHAT'S ON TV? {.section}

A recent study revealed that about one-fifth of all American pet owners
leave their TV or radio on for their
pets.[^2^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c07-nts2){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts2a
.hlink} The problem is that the television channels our pets end up
watching or listening to too often do more harm than good because
constant talk becomes an overpowering irritant or the programming
contains loud music or sounds interspersed with even louder commercials,
meaning the dog never receives an auditory break.

Luckily, production companies are aware of this issue and have begun
offering video products and actual TV channels like DogTV, which are
specifically designed to be watched by canines. The best of these
offerings are steadfastly committed to providing both an aural and
visual environment that is tailored specifically to the needs of today's
domesticated dog. The colors and frequencies of the visual and audio
content on these channels are specially designed to resonate positively
with our canine companions (see Canine Senses:
[Sight](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c04_r1.htm#ar4){.hlink} in chapter 4).
Another aspect of TV for dogs that breaks new ground is that it doesn't
simply attempt to calm a dog that may otherwise suffer from anxiety.
Those of us in the field of animal behavior who are involved with DogTV
have helped make sure that the channel's 24/7 content follows certain
timing rhythms.

If you invest in one of these channels for your dog, be aware that
rather than simply playing calming music and showing pictures of lulling
ocean surf, the content also slowly introduces and alternates between
scenes that are more stimulating from a dog's point of view. This will
ensure that throughout the lonely hours a dog is home with this channel
on in the background, there are periods of subtly increased motion and
tempo. As a result, the dog will be periodically and almost
imperceptibly stimulated, helping to minimize the boredom that can often
result in destructive behavior. This type of content is also
interspersed with periods
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page129}of "exposure" in which
dogs might hear, for example, the distant sound of a vacuum cleaner
played at very low levels, providing gradually increasing sound effects
that effectively desensitize dogs to everyday domestic environmental
sounds and help prevent noise sensitivities and phobias from ever
occurring.

Channels like DogTV are not designed to become "must see TV" for our
dogs, and it's perfectly okay for dogs not to want to become couch
"pet-atoes" once they're switched on. To the contrary, the real value in
TV for dogs can be found in those long hours when we're not around and
our dogs are otherwise either completely unstimulated or suffering from
separation distress.

Appropriate video content for canines is just one of many valuable tools
available to help ease our dogs' loneliness and provide comfort during
separation. I advise all pet parents to make time to watch the content
with their dog for short periods over a couple of days or have the
channel on in the background when home. This ensures that every dog's
reaction to the content can be monitored---because if a dog barks at or
rushes the television, DogTV is not right for him. Introducing the
channel when the owner is present will help provide a positive
association between the content and the comfort of the owner's presence,
making it easier for the dog to cope when his owners leave.

### COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES {.section}

There are many other complementary therapies that can be used with
behavior modification. Undetectable by humans, Dog Appeasing Pheromone
is a synthetically produced product that mimics the pheromones of a
lactating female and is said to produce a feeling of well-being and
reassurance for dogs, thereby reducing anxiety. It's available in spray
form and as a plug-in or can be contained in a collar worn around a
dog's neck. Lavender essence remedies can also help lessen anxiety, as
can massage and []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page130}other
similar therapies such as Reiki. I am generally a skeptic, but I once
witnessed a Reiki master put a rambunctious Standard Schnauzer into a
trance just by holding his hands an inch away from the dog's body. The
dog was in such a state of relaxation after ten minutes of "hand
hovering" that he soon fell asleep. I saw the same thing watching a
Basset Hound go through acupuncture. Anxious dogs might also feel calmer
when wearing a tightly wrapped coat, just as a baby calms when it's
swaddled. I encourage my clients to try natural remedies like these to
relieve their dog's stress, unless the anxiety is so pronounced that the
dog is unable to focus or learn anything. In such cases a veterinarian
or veterinary behaviorist can prescribe medication that will help the
dog get to a calmer state where learning can occur.

### MEDICATION {.section}

Dogs that are too stressed to respond to behavior modification may need
extra help to take the edge off their stress. Using mood stabilizing
medication with a behavior modification plan can sometimes make all the
difference in bringing a dog to the point where he is able to learn. Dr.
Dodman points out that medication can be used with or without behavior
modification, and even though this may encourage some people to rely on
medication alone, he makes the fair point that in reality some people
don't have the time or ability to follow what can be a time-consuming
teaching
plan.[^3^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c07-nts3){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts3a
.hlink} Most of these mood-enhancing modern drugs do not cause sedation,
nor do they negatively affect a dog's memory or ability to learn. A dog
on these medications will in fact find learning easier as the anxiety
lessens. Prozac, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that
blocks the reuptake of serotonin in the brain, has been found to be a
highly effective treatment for separation anxiety. Although some
behavioral scientists might argue that too much emphasis is being put on
the relationship []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page131}between
serotonin and mood, I have seen many anxious dogs improve dramatically
when prescribed drugs like Prozac (a brand name for fluoxetine). As with
any behavioral issue, however, it is vitally important that you take
your dog for a full medical checkup to rule out any medical causes and
to talk to your veterinarian about medications that may improve your
dog's behavior.

Whether you use complementary therapies or medication, always remember
that one tool alone is usually not enough to overcome an issue as
significant as separation distress. I believe these therapies should
always be combined with a behavior modification protocol, and more
serious cases usually require the assistance of a qualified positive
reinforcement--based dog trainer.

## Tips to Ease Separation Distress and Anxiety {.section}

::: hanging01
    • Start by taking your dog to the veterinarian to rule out any
medical cause for anxiety.

    • Increase your dog's daily activity; schedule exercise for a good
hour before you are due to leave home.

    • Go back to teaching 101! Teach activity cues that focus on impulse
control and problem solving.

    • Teach independence while you are home by routinely separating
yourself from your dog, especially when you go to the bathroom, take a
shower, or read a book.

    • Make it easier for your dog to cope with your absence by building
up a positive association with music from the Canine Noise Phobia Series
*Calming* CD.

    • Desensitize your dog to departure triggers. Constant repetitions
of departures and immediate returns can aid desensitization.

    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c07_r1.htm#page132}Vary your departure
cues.

    • Pair your departure with something pleasant by leaving your dog
with high-value chew toys.

    • Even out emotional highs and lows by not giving your dog too much
attention when you leave or return home.

    • Build up the time you are away from the home in small increments.
Your dog will dictate the pace, but take care not to go too far, too
fast.

    • If you work during the day, consider taking your dog to doggy day
care or hiring a dog walker.

    • If you have a channel like DogTV in your area, subscribe!

    • Use a video camera to record your dog's progress.

    • If your dog is too stressed to learn, consult with your
veterinarian about using medication to complement a behavioral
modification plan.
:::

In conclusion, dogs that find it hard to be alone need to be handled
sensitively, as panic upon separation is a terrible fear to
experience---particularly on a daily basis. Because there is no way to
tell your dog that your absence is only temporary, success depends on
your being present during the training process or having your dog with
others at all times when you cannot be there. The more your dog
experiences anxiety, the harder it will be to change his mind-set, but
if his anxiety levels are kept low throughout because you have made
arrangements never to leave him by himself during the modification
process, a successful outcome is much more likely.

# STRESS, ANXIETY, AND FEAR  [From Thunderstorm Phobia to Compulsive Behavior]{.small1} {.subchapter}

It is now generally accepted, based on decades of research, that dogs
not only experience emotions but also suffer from some of the same
emotional problems that people do, such as anxiety, depression, anger,
fear, compulsive disorders, and phobias. Unfortunately, I see many dogs
with emotional issues like these that make it hard for them to cope with
everyday life. Like people, some dogs are more sensitive than others to
the mental and physical manifestations of stress, so what may cause
sickness in one dog may have little effect on another even when both are
exposed to the same stressors. Although occasional mild stress can
actually be healthy, providing beneficial physical and mental
stimulation, research has shown that there is a link between chronic
stress and illnesses such as heart disease and gastrointestinal
disorders. Whether or not these diseases are actually caused by stress
is still unknown, but they are exacerbated by a stressful lifestyle,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page134}making understanding and
management of these disorders vital for a longer, healthier life.

Pet dogs are impressively adaptive. The ability to cope with new
environments and situations is a product of their domestication, and
most dogs do extremely well adapting to the pressures of domestic life.
There are some, however, that find it hard to adjust and consequently
live in a constant state of stress, making life difficult for themselves
and for their owners.

Understanding how stress affects our canine companions is easier once
you realize that dogs and humans have very similar physiological
responses to stress. During a stressful episode (let's say you and your
dog are being chased), both the human and the canine body experience
adaptive changes. For human or dog to survive, energy must immediately
be diverted to certain muscles in preparation for fight or flight.
Glucose, fats, and proteins pour out of the liver, fat cells, and unused
muscles and are sent to the muscles needing the most energy. Heart rate
and blood pressure are elevated in order to distribute the energy as
quickly as possible, while breathing becomes more rapid to meet the
demand for more oxygen. Digestion is suppressed, the immune system is
inhibited, and senses are sharpened. This all happens within a matter of
seconds and allows the body to operate at its optimum level to ensure
survival.

Under normal conditions it usually takes about two days for the stress
hormone cortisol to leave a dog's body after a traumatic episode. Humans
tend to have a harder time returning to "normal" because of their
ability to dwell on, anticipate, or expect future problems, but dogs
that are sensitive to the triggers that predict certain outcomes or that
are frequently exposed to something they fear can also find it hard to
de-stress. Good health depends on the body's ability to return to its
normal state after the stressful event, but if the body continues to
work at its optimum []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page135}level
and is unable to return to normal, it's only a matter of time before the
immune system is impaired, opening the door to adaptive illnesses such
as kidney disease, diabetes, and cancer.

Stressed and fearful dogs are often highly reactive and unable to
settle, jumping at the slightest sound or movement. This is due to an
overproduction of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones
foster a constant state of arousal in the brain as if the dog
anticipates a life-threatening event at every turn. This impedes the
learning brain from rationally deciding what is and is not threatening.
A lack of serotonin and dopamine, the two neurotransmitters in the brain
that help modulate responses and emotional activity, mixed with a high
level of stress hormones makes it very hard for a dog to listen and
focus on anything for more than a few seconds.

Sunny was a fearful three-year-old Terrier mix who reacted to every
small sound and visual stimulus in her environment, and there was
nothing her owner could do to calm her down. Sunny was in a constant
state of alert inside and outside the home, scanning her surroundings as
if she anticipated a threat to come at her from all sides. This made it
very hard for her to cope with any kind of social situation or change in
environment. Her brain continually operated in panic mode, and her
attention shifted so rapidly from one thing to another that she barely
had time to breathe. The poor dog was completely overwhelmed.

The stress and fear that dogs like Sunny experience are manifested in
physiological symptoms such as dilated pupils, sweaty paws, shaking, and
salivating. Other expressions come in the form of self-calming
techniques (such as yawning and lip licking) or intense displacement
behavior (such as sniffing, excessive grooming, spinning, or
self-mutilation). These dogs may urinate or defecate more frequently and
also suffer from digestive upset such as diarrhea. Some dogs may display
symptoms that look very
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page136}much like human
depression, including the inability to sleep, low energy, lack of
appetite, and a limited desire for human or dog interaction. Learned
helplessness, wherein the dog shuts down, is often misunderstood as a
dog becoming "calm submissive." It is yet another symptom of stress that
can occur if a dog is severely punished or suffers abuse. Aggressive
behaviors such as growling, snapping, and biting are common symptoms of
stress.

We now know that dogs also suffer from something very similar to the
human form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dr. Frank McMillan
of Best Friends Animal Sanctuary states that a single or chronic
exposure to a stressful or traumatic event may alter synaptic nerves,
resulting in chemical changes that increase anxiety-related behaviors
such as hyperreactivity, flashbacks, avoidance, mood swings,
irritability, "snapping" (not just a biting action, but the dog's
complete loss of control), insomnia, shut down, and
depression.[^1^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c08-nts1){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts1a
.hlink} Humans are able to assess, talk about, and analyze a traumatic
event; dogs, however, cannot rationalize and tell themselves there is
nothing to be scared of. Instinct tells them to fear because this keeps
them safe.

Research has shown that the better humans and animals can predict and
control outcomes in certain situations, the better their ability to
cope.[^2^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c08-nts2){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts2a
.hlink} When a dog's fear is so intense that it interferes with normal
life, his natural ability to acquire knowledge is inhibited and his
quality of life is negatively
affected.[^3^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c08-nts3){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts3a
.hlink}

So what can you do to minimize stress for your dogs, particularly if you
have a super-anxious dog like Sunny? First, it's important to realize
that dogs do not have the ability or intellectual desire to "change"
themselves, so human intervention is required to help them adapt by
using techniques that promote emotional change. Helping your dog learn
via gradual desensitization, counterconditioning techniques, management
of her exposure to stressors, and confidence-building exercises can be
of great help. []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page137}Minimizing
potential stressors at home and watching how you manage your own stress
is important, as dogs are very good at picking up on a person's
emotional state.

Controlled exercise is also a great way to alleviate stress and fear
both for dogs and people, as exercise improves cognitive function,
encourages confidence, stabilizes mood, and reduces reactivity while
improving the relationship between dog and owner. Developing coping
strategies---such as playing problem-solving games and using toys---can
help activate a dog's thinking brain in stressful situations, which in
turn deactivates the emotional brain and allows the dog to concentrate
on something more positive than the negative emotion. (For example, I'm
writing this on a plane that is flying close to a thunderstorm. The
plane is being tossed around like a tin can, but concentrating on
writing this chapter is preventing me from having the complete emotional
meltdown that I might otherwise be having if I were sitting on the plane
with nothing else to do but worry.)

## Thunderstorm Phobia {.section}

Working with dogs that have a fear or phobia can be complex, because
even though some common fears can be successfully managed, others are so
deeply ingrained that they are difficult to change. Thunderstorm phobia
is relatively common for dogs, particularly for those that live in areas
where stormy weather is commonplace. Recent reports have shown that 93
percent of dogs with noise phobias fear thunder and other loud noises,
including
fireworks.[^4^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c08-nts4){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts4a
.hlink} Whether fear of thunderstorms is caused by a single traumatic
experience or prolonged exposure, the result is often highly distressing
for dogs and owners. Without extensive behavioral therapy and management
strategies, phobias become deeply ingrained and even harder to overcome.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page138}I live in the
southeastern United States where thunderstorms are a common occurrence,
particularly in the spring and hot summer months. The intensity and
frequency of these thunderstorms can be frightening for anyone, but some
dogs are so traumatized that they are unable to function normally for
hours before and during a thunderstorm. Many thunderstorm-phobic dogs
adopt self-management strategies to cope, attempting to escape from the
home, digging into carpets, seeking out dark denlike spaces in which to
hide, pacing, or crawling behind a bathroom sink or toilet.

What makes behavioral modification in these cases so difficult is that
thunderstorms are not easy to predict or control. A dog usually knows
when a storm is coming long before a human does and becomes increasingly
panicked as it approaches.

It's possible to condition a dog to feel differently about storm noise
by gradually exposing the dog to audio recordings of storm sounds at low
volume levels and, if she appears relaxed, playing her favorite game or
feeding her her favorite food. Allowing a dog to play and relax in the
presence of the soft noise for short periods of time throughout the day
ensures that she does not become bored with the training. Introducing
the audio at a low level and gradually turning up the volume allows the
dog to habituate to the noise without a fear response.

I have taken this gradual adaptation process a step further by pairing
clinically demonstrated psycho-acoustic calming music (the same kind of
music I use for dogs that suffer with separation anxiety) with gradually
increasing levels of thunderstorm sound effects. This ground-breaking
complement to sensory education from my Canine Noise Phobia Series helps
dogs acclimate to thunderstorm sounds in a controlled environment. The
recording is uniquely constructed to enable dogs to "tune out" the
sounds of a thunderstorm. In addition to treating already present
thunderstorm phobias, this tool can be used to prevent thunderstorm
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page139}noise phobia and other
noise sensitivities from ever developing (see
[Resources](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_res_r1.htm){.hlink}).

The goal of this therapy is to change how a dog feels by altering the
way she hears the sound. My noise desensitization CDs encourage nervous
dogs to *passively hear* the noise rather than *actively listen* to it.
As you read this chapter, you may not be aware of other noises around
you, even though you are indeed passively hearing them. Stop reading
(for just a moment) and concentrate on the sounds in your environment.
Even though they've been there all the time, you haven't registered them
until now because you haven't been *actively listening* to them. Start
reading again, and after a while your brain will shut out the sounds
around you even though those sounds are still present. You may even
become aware of them again, but they probably won't bother you if you're
truly engaged in what you're reading. For a dog, the end result of this
noise desensitization process is that, even though she hears a
thunderstorm, the sound no longer overwhelms or scares her.

Gradually exposing a dog to flashes of light (by using the flash of a
camera, but not in the dog's face) that grow in intensity and using fans
to simulate increasing wind are complementary parts of this therapy, but
these can sometimes be harder to implement. Some dogs respond well to
all of these tools during teaching sessions but may still become
panicked when a real storm rolls in. It's therefore important to tackle
this phobia in other ways by using effective management strategies and
masking any visual stimuli that elicit a fear response during a storm.

Dogs can be very sensitive to changes in barometric pressure that occur
before a storm, but there is also a hypothesis that some
dogs---especially long-coated breeds---become statically charged during
a thunderstorm, receiving electric shocks from static in the air unless
they "ground" themselves. It's believed that dogs do this by retreating
to a bathroom and hiding behind a sink or
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page140}toilet, staying close to
pipes that provide electrical grounding. If the hypothesis is true, it
would certainly explain why so many dogs end up cowering in a bathroom.
To reduce static build-up, some owners wipe their dogs down with
antistatic laundry strips and spray antistatic spray on their dogs'
paws, but care should be taken to avoid using products that contain
harmful chemicals that dogs could lick
off.[^5^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c08-nts5){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts5a

The most important thing you can do for your thunderstorm-phobic dog is
to provide her with a "bolt hole"---a place she can escape to in the
event of a storm. Providing access to this safe place is essential at
all times, particularly if you are absent. This could be a closet,
bathroom, or basement (the best places usually have no windows), but
with plenty of artificial light to mask flashes of lightning. If static
electricity is a problem, rubber matting or tile is a good antistatic
material to use for flooring. Calming music should be played close to
the safe haven to mask the sounds of thunder. If you are present during
the storm, spend time with your dog in the safe haven or give her
attention if she comes to seek comfort. Far from reinforcing fearful
behavior, your presence will help your dog cope---as long as you remain
calm.

Some phobic dogs benefit from chewing on a food-stuffed toy or calming
therapies such as TTouch, anxiety wraps, pheromone collars, and lavender
essence; others do much better on anti-anxiety medication that can be
given just before a thunderstorm or by daily dosage, especially during
storm season. It is vital that behavioral therapy and management are
always implemented in tandem with any medication, to give the dog the
best possible chance of rehabilitation. Thunderstorm phobia is a
difficult condition to treat, but trying a variety of therapies and
techniques can help dogs cope when the big clouds roll in.

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page141}Obsessive Compulsive Disorders {.section}

A friend of mine exercised his Labrador puppy in the backyard each night
by encouraging his dog to chase a beam of light from a laser that he
shone on the ground. He now wonders why his adult dog is unable to focus
on anything except lights and reflections either inside or outside the
home. This dog's compulsive light chasing looks very like the human form
of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a potentially disabling
psychiatric condition in which obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions
such as hand washing, cleaning, hair plucking, or hoarding take over a
person's
life.[^6^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c08-nts6){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts6a
.hlink} Scientists and behavior professionals still debate whether we
should call the canine form of compulsive disorder "obsessive," because
we don't know what dogs are thinking, so the condition in some circles
is referred to as *canine compulsive disorder* (CCD). However, I see so
many cases where dogs seem obsessively compelled to indulge in
repetitive behaviors that I'm absolutely convinced what I'm seeing is an
obsessive disorder as well as a compulsion.

Canine OCD is exacerbated by anxiety, frustration, and stress, but there
is a genetic component as well, as many breeds suffer from specific
types of repetitive behavior. Spinning and tail chasing are prevalent in
Bull Terriers and German Shepherds; Dobermans are more prone to blanket-
or flank-sucking. Canine OCD can develop in dogs that lead
sensory-deprived lives when their basic or breed-specific needs are not
met. These dogs find other ways to cope with this deprivation by
indulging in repetitive actions---such as pacing, spinning, and
licking---that serve no meaningful function whatsoever except as an
outlet for their pent-up stress and frustration. The more these dogs
indulge in repetitive behaviors, the more ingrained these behaviors
become, until they simply cannot stop. Repetitive or displacement
actions are self-soothing at first and act as a release valve for extra
energy, but []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page142}when they
take over a dog's life, behaviors that previously soothed the dog now
actually increase the distress. Humans contribute to and exacerbate
canine OCD by confining their dogs for long hours in crates or small
kennel runs, failing to provide outlets for their dog's energy, or
treating their dogs harshly. Canine OCD has also been linked to seizure
disorders and abnormal brain function, which is why deeply ingrained
compulsions usually require medical intervention with anticonvulsant or
antiobsessional medication. This condition can manifest itself in many
different ways, each requiring careful consideration when determining
how best to try to manage them.

### SPINNING AND TAIL CHASING {.section}

Rocky the Wheaten Terrier bounced off the walls and spun in place
whenever a guest or family member came through the front door. Rocky had
a history of biting strangers, so his family kept him separated from
their guests, but this confinement caused such frustration that he
exploded whenever the doorbell rang, twirling and ricocheting off the
walls in the hallway.

Displacement behaviors such as spinning and licking normally occur as an
occasional response to a stressful episode. These behaviors become
obsessive, however, when they occur in other environments and situations
without a particular event that triggers the behavior. By the time I
arrived to help Rocky, his spinning was occurring in other locations
around the home, without the trigger of the doorbell, and couldn't be
stopped unless his family physically interrupted him.

The great sadness in this case was that it could have been easily solved
if the family had taken more responsibility for Rocky and actually
walked him. They had six capable people living in the home who could
have shared the responsibility, but they fought constantly about who was
going to do it. Considering some of
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page143}the things I've seen
during my career, I shouldn't be surprised by the way people behave
anymore, but this family was particularly shameful. They spent more time
arguing with each other than focusing on helping their dog get better.
Dr. Dodman, an expert in canine OCD, even came to provide additional
assistance, but the family refused to follow through with the generous
support that was offered.

When I took Rocky and his family to a large off-leash space to see how
he behaved, he became a different dog. The pure joy I saw on his face as
he ran around the field was a testament to how much he enjoyed and
needed this daily outlet. As he raced around the open fields, the family
was delighted to see their usually anxious dog so happy, but I had
little confidence that they would continue to exercise him in this way
after I had gone. Even though Rocky showed great improvement during my
time with him, repeated attempts to maintain contact with the family and
monitor his progress failed, and a year later I heard that he had been
rehomed. I hope he is having a better life with people who actually care
about his well-being.

When I met Lottie she, too, spun around in circles, but she had a valid
reason: she was hell-bent on trying to catch her tail. It infuriated her
that the furry little nub above her backside was just out of her reach,
but that didn't stop her from trying. Lottie had been rescued from a
backyard breeder who kept all his puppies and dogs in tiny crates, and I
believe her tail chasing had entertained and soothed her during her
confinement. Even with a new home, a loving family, and more space
around her, the behavior was so deeply ingrained that she continued to
chase her tail whenever she got the chance.

Dogs that chase their tails tend to have high prey drive, and Lottie was
no exception. Each time she spun, her tail moved away from her like prey
trying to escape.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page144}Because of Lottie's high
drive, she had a tendency to run away on walks, and the family didn't
feel confident walking her off the leash. I gave them a long line and an
extendable leash so that she would safely get the exercise she needed
while building up a reliable recall. Extendable leashes should only be
used in open areas, and care should be taken to ensure that dogs don't
hurt themselves. Used correctly, however, this leash was a godsend that
allowed the family to take Lottie into the woods and give her
stimulating outside experiences. I also found a fenced-in field that
they could use where Lottie could run with abandon and indulge her love
of chasing prey by going after the balls and squeaky toys the family
threw for her.

Increased exercise and mental stimulation helped Lottie calm down when
she was at home, and her spinning decreased indoors. The backyard still
seemed to trigger the behavior, however, so we limited access and only
allowed Lottie out when she was actively playing with her family. I also
purchased long agility tunnels and arranged them in straight lines
around the yard to encourage her to go forward rather than round and
round in circles!

### AIR SNAPPING {.section}

Interestingly, some dogs appear to watch and bite at imaginary flies in
front of their face---a behavior particularly prevalent among some
breeds, including German Shepherds and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.
There are a number of suspected causes for this behavior, including
partial epileptic seizures, hallucinations, and, in Cavaliers, a
devastating disease called *syringomyelia*. When the cerebrospinal fluid
is prevented from circulating normally between the brain and spinal cord
due to a narrowing or blockage of the flow, this forces the fluid into
the spinal cord at a higher than normal rate, causing the spinal cord to
expand or pull apart, creating a cavity and squeezing fluid from blood
vessels and other []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page145}tissues
into the
cavity.[^7^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c08-nts7){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts7a
.hlink} This causes migraine-like headaches and pain around the neck and
shoulders that the dog tries to ease by snapping or scratching at its
neck. A study in Sweden by Dr. Jens Haggstrom demonstrated that fly
snapping could also be linked to a condition known as *idiopathic
asymptomatic thrombocytopenia*, which causes an abnormally low level of
blood platelets, affecting the circulation of blood in the
brain.[^8^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c08-nts8){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts8a
.hlink} Dogs that exhibit this behavior require a full medical
examination to rule out the possibility of a serious medical condition
or seizure activity, but if a clean bill of health is given, the
behavior could be a compulsion, depending on the context in which it
happens. As with all compulsive behaviors, a full behavioral history and
evaluation should be taken and the appropriate therapies prescribed,
with medication if needed.

### FLANK AND BLANKET SUCKING {.section}

Before Sadie came into our home at the age of five, she had lived a
pretty boring life. She was hugely overweight but nevertheless would
lunge at other dogs when they passed by. She had spent the first five
years of her life with an elderly woman who gave her plenty of love but
couldn't walk her, and as a result Sadie spent her days licking her paws
and chewing on her flank. I wasn't so concerned about the licking,
because I knew she suffered from allergies that made her paws itch, but
the flank sucking was something of a mystery. At first I thought she
might be targeting her flank to relieve referred pain from somewhere
else in her body, but after further study it became evident that it was
a habit that gave her comfort. It almost looked like she was nursing on
herself, and indeed dogs that indulge in this behavior do so to soothe
themselves, rather like a baby sucking on a pacifier. Puppies gain food
and comfort from their mother when nursing, and sometimes after weaning,
this need for comfort is transferred to something different such as a
blanket, human skin, or the dog's own body.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page146}As soon as Sadie came to
us, her life was enriched by exercise, activities, and positive
attention. This redirected her licking and flank sucking almost
overnight, but there were still times when she reverted to her old
habits. During quiet times of the day, I fastened a surgery cone around
her neck, a temporary solution that inhibited her ability to practice
the behavior while I investigated other causes and solutions. I wouldn't
recommend using a cone full time, as most dogs despise them, but Sadie's
flank had been raw and red from her chewing, and the wound needed to
heal. After a thorough medical check-up I discovered she was hypothyroid
(thyroid issues have been shown to exacerbate flank-sucking
behavior[^9^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c08-nts9){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts9a
.hlink}); with the medication she was prescribed to stabilize her
hormone levels, increased attention, and more exercise, her flank
sucking eventually became a thing of the past.

### LIGHT AND SHADOW CHASING {.section}

Max was a magnificent Gordon Setter who had an obsession for chasing
reflections and shadows inside and outside the home. This made working
with him very difficult, because whenever he saw a flicker of light he
stopped whatever he was doing, fixated on it as if in a trance, and then
licked where the shadow or reflection had been. Teaching outside on a
sunny day was impossible, and the only way I could snap him out of his
fixation was to put on his leash and physically walk him away.

Max's intense fixation and licking had to be redirected onto something
more positive. His exercise needs were being met, but his home
environment had to be managed. It was very hard for his family to cook
anything in the kitchen, for example, because Max tried to chase the
reflections made by the metal pans used for cooking. For his own and his
family's safety, he was kept out of the kitchen whenever meals were
being prepared. As I do with all the compulsive dogs I meet, I enriched
his environment in other
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page147}ways by giving him
interactive toys and feeding him his meals in nonreflective treat balls
rather than from his bowl. Max had great hunting, seeking, and
problem-solving skills, so I was pleased to see that he now spent more
time working with the toys and puzzles I gave him than staring at
reflections.

I eventually learned that Max had started life as a mascot for an army
regiment in Scotland. His home was the regiment's ballroom, which was
lined from floor to ceiling with mirrors. When the sun shone, light
reflected from all sides, which meant he must have spent many hours
entertaining himself by chasing the reflections made by the mirrors. In
Max's case it seemed that situational reinforcement had helped encourage
a light-chasing habit that had quickly gotten out of control.

### LICKING {.section}

I don't see many cases in which both dog and owner demonstrate
repetitive, compulsive behavior, but Zulu, a Boxer, and his owner, Mark,
were an exception. Zulu had recently moved with his family from a large
home in South Africa to a tiny condo near Heathrow, London, so the dog
had gone from a huge backyard to one that he could barely run in. Rather
than running, as he had used to do, Zulu spent all his pent-up energy
jumping up onto the eight-foot-high fence his owners had built around
the small yard. He never made it to the top, but his jumping made the
family nervous. Zulu's frustration also manifested itself in his
constant licking of household objects and people, including sofas,
chairs, curtains, clothes, carpets, and Mark's bald head, a behavior
that Mark actively encouraged. Interestingly, Mark also suffered from a
compulsive disorder. He obsessed about his furniture getting scratched
and spent a good deal of his free time inspecting his home; even a tiny
scratch meant the furniture had to be replaced. His compulsion had
become worse after the transfer because he
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page148}missed his former home so
much. As I walked around the house, making sure I didn't touch anything,
it was obvious to me that both dog and owner had been stressed out by
the move.

Some dogs are prone to compulsive self-grooming on a particular area of
the body, causing wounds to form and making them hard to heal. This is
called *acral lick dermatitis* (ALD) or *lick granuloma*, but licking
can also occur on other areas, objects, or materials as a displacement
behavior for a dog's boredom or anxiety, resulting in an obsessive
behavior that is hard to change. It was evident that Zulu's dramatic
change of environment had made the licking worse, and of course, as in
so many cases I see, he needed more exercise. I provided Zulu with an
assortment of activity toys and puzzles that were rotated each day and
given at certain times when his licking was more likely to occur.
Because he loved to jump, he started agility classes at the local
training club. In addition to increased exercise, I encouraged the
family to play with him as much as they could in their tiny backyard and
implement a teaching program to engage his brain and redirect the
licking onto something more appropriate. Mark admitted that the hardest
behavior to change was his own, as he loved the feeling of Zulu licking
his bald head!

Zulu's compulsion resolved with behavioral therapy, but some dogs are so
obsessed that medication along with a behavioral modification plan is
the only combination that works. Many of these disorders occur because
of a chemical imbalance in the brain. When this is the case,
behavior-modifying drugs can dramatically improve the life of a dog with
OCD. These drugs can be taken for life or for a limited period of time
as a support to a positive behavior modification program.

Dealing with your dog's stress, fear, and phobias can be extremely
challenging. Keep in mind that although these issues may sometimes be
difficult to cure completely, it is possible,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c08_r1.htm#page149}through the
implementation of various positive training protocols, to reduce them to
a manageable level. The physiological impact of stress on dogs can be
significant, so it's critical to stay attuned to your dog's emotional
responses and prevent any seemingly harmless quirks from developing into
potentially damaging obsessions or anxieties. Always start by figuring
out where, when, and why the behavior started. For more severe cases,
work with your veterinarian to rule out any medical conditions, and with
a reward-based training professional to help you develop an effective
behavior modification program.

# CANINE AGGRESSION  [From Resource Guarding to Leash Aggression]{.small1} {.subchapter}

Defining aggression is not easy, because there are so many variables
associated with this highly complex behavior. But by investigating the
function served by an aggressive act, we can begin to gain a better
understanding. At its core, aggressive behavior addresses the dog's need
to increase distance from a perceived danger and includes threat and
action displays ranging from a subtle lip lift to a deep bite. In most
cases the intention is not so much to harm as it is to change the
"threat's" behavior by making it go
away.[^1^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts1){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts1a
.hlink}

Aggressive behavior is deeply rooted in the dog's instinctual need for
safety. Growling, snapping, lunging, and biting are critical ways of
communicating intent, and whether that intent is to warn, intimidate,
resolve conflict, increase distance, defend, or cause harm, aggressive
behavior is designed to ensure personal safety and survival. Even on an
emotional level, when a dog is fearful, frustrated, angry, anxious,
stressed, or in pain, safety is of paramount importance.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page152}As discussed, some people
explain all aggressive behavior in terms of dominance, but as we now
know, using the "d word" is misleading. The term itself suggests that
the dog has a preconceived plan to use aggression as a means of
establishing elevated status; this fuels an owner's anger and encourages
a rank-reduction protocol involving punishment, confrontation, and other
unpleasant methods to establish an owner's authority. This in turn
increases the likelihood that the dog will aggress again in the future.

Although aggressive behavior is an effective way for dogs to control
their environment, affect behavior in others, ensure priority access to
resources, and achieve reproductive success, explaining dogs' aggression
in terms of a supposed desire to be the "alpha" grossly misinterprets
the source of the aggression. A more accurate explanation is that a dog
that has not been taught how to function successfully in a domestic
environment will behave the only way he knows how. He may use aggression
to control access to food, space, furniture, or other things that
provide comfort and pleasure, but this is more likely done out of fear
that he will lose access to those resources than because he wants to be
"above" everyone else in the household.

So if attaining the position of "alpha" is not the root cause of
domestic dogs' aggressive behavior, what is? Genetics, health, age, sex,
fear, imbalance of brain chemicals, hormones, and whether the dog is
intact or neutered are factors that influence aggressive behavior.
Studies show, for example, that due to higher testosterone levels,
intact male dogs between eighteen months and two years of age have a
greater incidence of aggression than females or neutered
males.[^2^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts2){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts2a
.hlink} Dogs may also bite when in pain and for other medical reasons,
but there are some cases of aggression that simply cannot be easily
explained. These cases are categorized as *idiopathic* (unexplained)
aggression, which manifests itself as a sudden explosion absent of any
known trigger. Idiopathic aggression has
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page153}been linked to chemical
disturbances in the brain, such as canine
epilepsy.[^3^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts3){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts3a
.hlink}

There is a clear link between anger, anxiety, and fear-based aggressive
behavior. This has recently been demonstrated by Dr. Steven Hamilton at
the University of California and Dr. Karen Overall at the Center for
Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of Pennsylvania. Hamilton
and Overall found that dogs with a history of aggression problems have
levels of neurotransmitters and stress hormones similar to those of dogs
that suffer from fear and
anxiety.[^4^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts4){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts4a
.hlink} When a dog aggresses, he surpasses his stress threshold, causing
his limbic system (the emotional brain) to take over as he prepares for
flight or fight. When this occurs, the cerebral cortex (the thinking
brain) is inhibited, explaining why it is so hard to get a reactive
dog's attention and encourage him to learn: while he is aggressing, he
is incapable of rational thought. A punitive trainer might respond by
trying to suppress the aggressive outburst with punishment, whereas a
positive trainer would immediately remove the dog from the stressor by
quickly walking him away or creating some distraction to cut through the
reaction. Only when the dog is in a calmer state can he begin to learn
again. *The secret to successfully treating aggression is to never put
your dog in a situation where he goes beyond his stress threshold*. This
requires sensitive, compassionate handling and manipulation of his
environment to set him up for success while working on changing the way
he feels about a particular stressor.

Unfortunately, we cannot sit down with our dogs and ask them how they
feel, but we can observe them closely to understand *why* they feel. We
can help an aggressive dog become more confident by teaching him to see
a perceived threat or potential loss of a valued resource in a different
light. This is the key to successfully changing the behavior. For some
dogs this can be achieved relatively quickly, but others require more
time; each []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page154}dog learns at
a different pace. Positive reinforcement is the most effective
philosophy to use in these cases, because the methods have a lasting
impact, even on the "red zone" dogs.

Most owners want quick fixes for their dog's aggressive behavior because
they worry about what damage their dog might do, but the "quick fix"
idea demeans a dog's emotional experience and is psychologically
unachievable. When a dog is suffering from anxiety or fear, professing
that he can be "fixed" quickly is a dangerous idea and fundamentally
wrong.

Imagine what would happen if a person who suffered from chronic fear or
attacks of anxiety went to their psychotherapist and was guaranteed he
would be "cured" in an hour, a day, or even a few weeks. This guarantee
would be false, and that therapist wouldn't be in business for long.

A dog needs time and gentle support to change the way he feels
emotionally, and even though some behavioral modification processes take
more time and effort on the front end, the result is a lifetime of
positively changed behavior. Punitive training suppresses the behavior
without addressing the cause and changing the way the dog feels inside,
so even though it may look like the dog is "behaving" better after being
punished, the negative behavior will continue to occur. Continual
suppression of aggressive behavior through punishment is very dangerous
because every incident creates another negative experience for a dog
that is already about to explode.

Unlike other manifestations of aggressive behavior, predatory aggression
is not emotionally driven and is largely influenced by genetics. Some
dogs find it reinforcing to chase other animals or moving objects as it
fulfills an instinctive need, but this is only the beginning of the
predatory sequence. Over thousands of years, humans have bred the desire
to bite and kill out of the domestic dog, but occasionally a deeper
instinct takes over. Although
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page155}many dogs, including my
Sadie, enjoy shaking and disemboweling stuffed toys, this sequence does
not translate to live animals or people. Herding breeds are adept at
eyeing, stalking, and chasing their "prey," but they will seldom attack
and kill the animals they are herding. Dogs that are motivated by the
chase, grab, bite, and kill part of the sequence can be very dangerous
to live with, especially around small animals and children.

Aggressive behavior therefore serves many important functions for dogs;
it is a deeply rooted natural instinct that ensures reproductive
success, safety, and survival. If aggression is successful, it can be an
effective way to repel a perceived threat and to control resources,
space, and environment. On an emotional level, aggressive behavior is
very stressful for a dog, especially if the behavior is triggered by a
traumatic incident, abusive handling, or an inability to cope with
continually changing environments. Regardless of origins or intent,
aggression is almost never a useful or wanted behavior in any domestic
environment and must be treated appropriately to preserve the well-being
of the dog, his environment, and his human family.

## The Limitations of "Quick Fix" Training {.section}

Angela and her daughter moved into a beautiful new home after selling
the family business and desperately wanted a dog. During a trip to the
local pet store, they spied Tink, an eight-week-old Basset Hound,
staring at them through the store window. Angela knew the puppy came
from a puppy mill but couldn't resist the cute little face that looked
up at her, so without much hesitation she purchased Tink for an enormous
sum of money. All went well for the first few months until Tink began to
show a "stubborn" side. Concerned that her pup was getting out of
control, Angela
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page156}immediately contacted a
trainer from a well-known training company, who put a shock collar
around the pup's neck and "electrically corrected" her each time she
misbehaved. Because Tink was a "naughty" little puppy, she received many
such corrections, some so harsh that a small burn mark appeared on her
neck. Tink finally "learned her lesson" and became very obedient,
listening to everything the trainer said and complying with Angela's
every wish. Angela wasn't comfortable using the shock collar, but Tink
was finally becoming the obedient puppy she had always wanted.

A month after shock training started, Angela noticed that although Tink
was still listening to her, she had lost her puppy vitality, becoming
quiet and spending long hours asleep during the day. Angela began to
worry that her dog seemed disconnected and depressed. Worse still, Tink
had started to lunge and aggress toward other dogs---successfully
attacking the unlucky few with whom she had come in contact. Even though
Angela turned the collar to the highest setting to curb this behavior,
it didn't seem to be working. She contacted the trainer again, who this
time swapped the shock collar for one that sprayed Tink in the face
every time she aggressed. Three thousand dollars' worth of training
later, Tink was "fixed" again, and walks became more enjoyable for
Angela.

However, as is common with quick fixes, they quickly come unstuck. Soon,
neither shock nor spray could stop Tink's aggressing, so the trainer
told Angela that in his opinion Tink was a lost cause and should be put
down. Angela reluctantly agreed and scheduled a date for the euthanasia
but couldn't bring herself to go through with it, so she stopped walking
Tink altogether, confining her to the house and a tiny backyard. Angela
didn't like that she had to keep her dog in the home, but it was the
only way to ensure everyone's safety. Without exercise Tink became even
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page157}more unsettled and
anxious, tuning out her family completely and plunging into a nervous
depression.

Angela was clearly distressed when she contacted me because she felt
like she had failed her dog. As I walked up to the house and saw Tink
watching me through the railings I understood why Angela had fallen in
love with her. The big droopy face and huge floppy ears could not fail
to melt even the hardest heart, and her sweet greeting made it difficult
to think she was anything but an angel.

Even though thousands of dollars had been spent on "training," the harsh
techniques had done nothing but cause significant damage. Like so many
owners, Angela had taken little time to educate herself about training
methods and employed a trainer from what she thought was a reputable
company. But instead of focusing on basic learning skills and treating
the root cause of Tink's negative behavior in a positive way, the
trainer she employed taught her dog to obey through punishment and used
man-made devices designed to suppress negative behavior through
discomfort and pain. When this failed to put Tink "in her place," the
trainer gave up, labeled her a liability, and recommended euthanasia.

It didn't take long for Angela to realize that consigning Tink to a
lifetime of harmful punishment was having a detrimental effect on her
dog both physically and mentally. The only thing Tink had learned so far
in her short life was to fear everything. If she approached the sofa,
walked on the Persian rug, ignored a command, jumped up, mouthed,
toileted in the home, or lunged at a dog outside, she received a painful
shock. Tink's resulting mental instability had been shaped by the harsh
training she'd received, and this damaged dog had no trust in or
connection with Angela at all.

Shock attempts to suppress a dog's negative behavior with static
electricity and the resulting "obedience" is labeled a "success"
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page158}by those who use this
method. However, just because a particular behavior has been
*suppressed* does not mean that the behavior has *improved*. Even though
supporters of electronic shock collar training may praise its supposed
effectiveness, ultimately dogs trained using shock will comply or
cooperate only out of fear. Such a dog is not being obedient in the true
sense of the word, but rather practicing avoidance. Shock controls a dog
without allowing that dog to be given a chance to make choices and solve
problems, and this often leads to learned helplessness and essentially
cripples the dog's true learning
ability.[^5^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts5){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts5a
.hlink}

Proponents of shock training often claim that the method gets a bad rap
due to misuse by people who don't really understand how to do it
"correctly." Regardless of how high you set the dial and the timing
employed when delivering the shock, the unpleasant fundamental truths
about how this method truly affects an animal's behavior cannot be
disputed. I've also heard trainers justify their use of shock collars by
calling the training "gentle persuasion," but it's about as gentle as
punching someone in the neck with a smile on your face.

I don't blame dog owners who are unaware of the negative consequences
and limited results of shock training, but I do believe that anyone who
wants the best for their dog should fully research the most appropriate
and humane dog training methods available and understand the
repercussions of punishment techniques. I know that some dog training
companies and individuals have very sophisticated and deceptive sales
pitches that persuade even those who instinctively *know* that shocking
their dog is not the right thing to do. But I reserve my utmost disdain
for those who have studied behavior enough to know the truth and still
decide that it's okay to use shock and other harsh aversives.

Rehabilitating a dog that had suffered such abuse was going to be tough,
but I was confident that a humane approach would go
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page159}a long way toward
reestablishing trust. The most difficult problem to overcome was Tink's
reactivity toward other dogs. It was vital she have exercise, but her
reaction was so intense, I could understand Angela's deep concerns about
walking her.

## Leash Aggression {.section}

Leash reactivity and aggression are exacerbated by a dog's feeling
restrained and therefore unable to act naturally in a social situation.
In normal circumstances, an unleashed dog could put sufficient distance
between himself and a fear source. But leashed he is unable to increase
distance. His only option is to react aggressively in the hope that the
fear source will go away, bringing him profound relief. The more success
he has with his aggressive display, the more he will use it in similar
situations. In response, the owner becomes tense when walking and keeps
the leash tight, transmitting nerves and fears down the leash to the dog
and effectively making the behavior worse. Dog and owner are locked in a
cycle of tension and leash lunging that becomes very difficult to
change.

To begin Tink's rehabilitation, I concentrated on basic focus training
in and out of the home, teaching her to look at and take cues from
Angela while gaining confidence in different environments. Even though
Angela was nervous to walk Tink outside, it was vital that she not only
observe her dog's body language---to pick up any signals of heightened
arousal or discomfort---but also to appear confident and provide support
at all times so that Tink could learn from her. I knew that Tink's
discomfort around other dogs stemmed from her lack of exposure to them
when she was younger. She clearly didn't understand canine language, and
this put her on the defensive whenever she encountered another dog.

Not all dogs that lunge on the leash are necessarily displaying
aggression---some are simply acting out of pure frustration. I have
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page160}worked with many dogs
that are highly reactive on leash, but as soon as the leash relaxes or
they have freedom, they greet other dogs and people appropriately and
invite play. If you have a social, yet frustrated dog, simply turn and
walk him away from the source until he is more composed; allow him to
greet only when he is calm and the leash is loose. Some leash lungers
feel more confident carrying a "security blanket"---a comforting
object---when they walk. Walking with a toy in the mouth, which acts
like a child's pacifier, comforts and keeps the dog relaxed.

The punishment Tink had received for lunging made her behavior even
worse. Because Tink had been punished each time she reacted negatively
toward an approaching dog, she began to associate the sight of other
dogs with the pain of punishment. As soon as I started changing her
emotional response by redirecting her focus and playing with her when
she saw other dogs, her discomfort around them turned into curiosity.

The brain's circuits for aggression are separate from those for play; by
playing with Tink near other dogs I was effectively engaging her play
drive and shutting off any fear she felt. This increased the levels of
dopamine in her brain, which not only helped her feel good but also
changed the way she perceived another dog's presence. There is such a
thin line between calm and fearful behavior, so I had to go carefully,
gradually reducing the distance between the dogs while keeping Tink
comfortable. If at any point she reacted negatively, I quietly walked
her away, waited until she was in a state that allowed her to learn
again, and then repeated the process.

Slowly but surely, Tink began to associate the sight of other dogs with
positive things that made her feel good. The key to changing the way a
dog behaves is to change how he feels. Even though the punishment she'd
received in the past had suppressed her negative behavior at that
moment, it had done nothing to
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page161}change the way she felt
emotionally, so the real problem had never been resolved.

For the first time, Tink was given the freedom to make better choices
around other dogs---choices that made her feel good. The change in her
behavior was almost immediate, as this broken dog became eager and
motivated, walking past other dogs with no reaction at all. In fact, it
seemed that she was now ready to experience her first greeting. I never
like to allow insecure dogs to greet face to face to begin with, as the
pressure of a facial greeting can be too stressful, so we practiced
parallel walking and following other dogs until we got to the point
where Tink experienced her first bottom sniff. Angela and I must have
looked like a couple of madwomen as we celebrated this monumental
moment, but it signified a huge breakthrough in Tink's learning process.
We continued to practice "curved greetings," in which both dogs were
walked toward each other in an arc rather than head on, mimicking
appropriate canine greeting language. The dogs were allowed to greet for
a few seconds and then moved away in opposite directions, but the face
time increased with each subsequent meeting. Tink made her first
friend---a trusty old male Beagle called Walter. Walking with Walter
gave her confidence, and they met up daily to experience the joys of
ambling together. When the time was right, we began adding other dogs to
the mix and developed a regular walking group. Watching Tink play with
her new buddies, I couldn't help but think what a tragedy it would have
been if Angela had followed that final piece of advice from her former
trainer.

Tink had suffered so much throughout her most important developmental
period simply because her trainer and owner didn't understand the value
of a positive learning experience. There are still people who vehemently
defend electronic shock collar training, saying that when used
correctly, these collars are a minor
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page162}irritation but do not
cause pain. Even if that were the case (and it's usually not), why
resort to shock when you can get much better results with methods that
motivate a dog to behave without force and without any possibility of
discomfort or damage? And even if a trainer knows exactly how to operate
a collar effectively, the majority of dog owners do not have this
"skill." Positive reinforcement offers a wealth of great alternative
methods that can dramatically modify even the most intense behaviors in
our dogs. Angela experienced the power of positive reinforcement
firsthand and saw how it changed her dog's life for the better as well
as her own.

## Back Off, It's Mine!---Resource Guarding {.section}

Caspar stood stiffly over his bowl and ate slowly with one eye on his
food and the other on us. Quietly and deliberately, Caspar growled---a
deep, guttural sound that clearly told us to back away. Caspar's owners
couldn't understand where this guarding behavior had come from, because
otherwise he was a loving, joyful animal. But as feeding time
approached, Caspar became watchful and wary. So far the couple had
heeded his warnings, but it was only a matter of time before a bite
occurred, and with a new baby on the way, it was vital they get his
behavior under control.

I have worked with many dogs that guard their resources, but Caspar, a
neutered two-year-old Shepherd mix, was a particularly tough one. He had
been adopted from a shelter at the age of three months and was the only
pet in the household. His owners were a hard-working young couple who
gave him everything he wanted, but they had noticed this guarding
behavior since the first day they adopted him---a major red flag.
Guarding food at such a young age indicated that, along with other
contributing factors, this behavior probably had a genetic component,
and I would not []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page163}have been
surprised if somewhere in Caspar's family tree there were other
practiced resource guarders.

Caspar's owners couldn't understand why he felt the need to guard his
food bowl so viciously from them. They had what they thought was a good
relationship with their dog and had always been careful not to challenge
him. But despite this solid relationship, Caspar continued to guard his
food---a behavior relatively common among domestic dogs and usually
influenced by a number of environmental and situational stimuli,
including a dog's natural instinct to survive.

A dog that has primary access to food has nutritional and therefore
reproductive advantage over others, and even though thousands of years
of domestication have changed today's dog in many ways, instincts like
this can remain deeply rooted. Because dogs have evolved from
scavengers, other animals can be viewed as competitors for food, which
threatens an individual's survival. In this context, guarding access to
scraps becomes extremely important. Caspar was deeply insecure and saw
everyone, including his owners, as a threat to a resource he valued.
Food made him feel good, and the potential of losing a resource that
gave him pleasure encouraged his vigilance, anger, and irritability.

Because it's difficult for people to understand why dogs guard and why
there is social competition, many owners get angry and confrontational
with their dogs. Yet most warm-blooded animals, including humans, guard
possessions and resources that are important to them. Any "machismo"
fighting or wrangling a dog into submission will just increase that
dog's desire to compete. Using positive reinforcement methods instead
builds up trust by changing the way a dog feels about someone's presence
near resources that he values.

I began teaching Caspar by changing the physical picture, giving him a
new bowl, and placing it in a different location. I then
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page164}varied feeding times so
that he never had the chance to become tense when his body clock told
him that is was time for food.

I utilized the *empty bowl method* by picking his bowl up, pretending to
fill it with kibble, then placing it on the ground in front of him.
Caspar went eagerly toward it but found that is was empty. Perplexed, he
looked first at his owners and then at me. As soon as he looked at me, I
praised him and threw a bit of kibble into his bowl. After he had
finished eating he looked at me again and was rewarded with more food. I
repeated this a dozen times until all his food had been eaten. Caspar
was now beginning to understand that I was becoming a positive part of
his feeding experience because I was providing him with food, and my
presence at his bowl also signaled that he was going to get more. I
advised Caspar's owners to feed every meal to him for the following week
just as I had done, so he would become comfortable while he was eating.
As his behavior gradually improved, the couple began throwing in larger
handfuls of kibble. Eventually they were able to place his bowl full of
food on the ground and watch him eat while he remained relaxed in their
presence.

During this first part of the training, the couple was to remain
motionless near Caspar's bowl, because in the past, movement from them
had elicited a negative reaction. So that the couple could walk past his
feeding area comfortably, I taught them to pass by his empty bowl and
throw a piece of chicken into it. Every time they approached his empty
bowl, Caspar would run toward them, eagerly anticipating the tasty
treat. Having repeated this action many times, the couple then walked by
his bowl while he was eating his kibble and threw in the higher-value
food. Within a month Caspar's guarding behavior had completely
disappeared.

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page165}The Trade---Teaching the "Take It and Drop It" Cue {.section}

You can prevent resource guarding from developing in the first place by
teaching your puppy or dog to trade and give up objects, making the
whole experience a game. Giving your puppy a high-value chew toy and
holding onto the other end for a short period of time while he chews
will allow him to be confident about your presence near his high-value
objects. People often make a guarding situation worse by being
confrontational and threatening when their dogs refuse to give up an
object. However, if you turn the whole process into a game of trade by
teaching the "take it and drop it" game, your dog will feel good about
giving up any object he has in his mouth.

### STAGE ONE---THE TRADE {.section}

Start with an object of low value and present it to your dog. When he
opens his mouth to take the object, say "take it."

Allow him to play with the object; then present him with a duplicate
that you have behind your back. As your dog drops the object he has in
his mouth, say "drop it" and reward him with the duplicate that you have
in your other hand, saying "take it."

### STAGE TWO--ADDING VALUE {.section}

Keep repeating this exercise; when your dog is consistently complying,
you can gradually build up the value of the toy. If he doesn't want to
give up the higher-value toy, walk away from him, produce a new toy, and
start directing all your interest to that new toy while you play with
it. Most likely his curiosity will get the
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page166}better of him, and he
will come over and give up the toy he has in his mouth. Immediately
reward his decision by giving him the new toy and repeating the "take
it," "drop it" sequence.

### THE EMERGENCY "DROP IT" {.section}

If you are in a crisis situation and your dog won't give up the
delicious (but dangerous) chicken bone in his mouth, you can try playing
the "go find it" game. Without moving toward your dog as he is eating,
start dropping small high-value treats on the ground where he can see
you. Tell your dog to "go find" the treats you have dropped. Nine times
out of ten, your dog will let go of whatever he has in his mouth to play
the game. You can encourage this process by teaching him the game in
other circumstances so that it's not only associated with when he steals
something. This exercise helps lower his perception of threat, focuses
his mind on something that makes him feel good, and prevents both of you
from getting into a situation that could be dangerous. If you don't have
high-value food available when your dog has something in his mouth, then
your only alternatives are to let him eat it (and observe him closely
afterward to make sure there are no bad aftereffects) or implement a
major distraction, such as ringing the doorbell or getting his leash to
take him on a walk. These distractions may be far more exciting than
eating or holding onto whatever he has picked up.

Dogs will also guard other objects such as toys, and locations such as
beds, sofas, or other valued space. If your dog is a resource guarder,
you can prevent this other guarding behavior by removing objects or
cutting off access to prized locations.

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page167}TIPS TO PREVENT GUARDING {.section}

::: hanging01
    • Change your dog's emotional response to something he values by
teaching him to feel differently about your presence near these
resources.

    • Implement distractions, like ringing the doorbell or making a
noise in another room, to encourage your dog to leave whatever object or
location he is guarding so that you can safely remove the object or
block access to the location.

    • Give your dog enough outlets in his day to enrich his environment.
Occupying his mind will give him something else to focus on.

    • Train a conditioned response, such as the "take it" and "drop it"
cues. This takes the emotion out of what can be a hard thing for dogs to
do.

    • Keep things predictable. Resource guarders do not like surprises.

    • Avoid confrontation. Use play instead, turning competition into
cooperation.

## Five's a Crowd---Aggression in a Multidog Household {.section}

Judy and Louie had a soft spot for small dogs. The once happily married
couple had taken in rescue dogs for many years and always enjoyed doing
so until they adopted a Toy Poodle named Manny. As soon as Judy saw him,
she knew she had to have the little guy, but when they brought him home,
a previously calm household changed overnight. Not only was the couple's
marriage suffering because of Manny's behavior, but so were their other
dogs---five-year-old Lhasa Apsos, Shayna and Butch. Manny had what the
couple described as a "Jekyll and Hyde" personality:
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page168}one moment he was sweet
and cuddly, the next he attacked violently, especially if anyone
approached Judy while he was close to her. Manny had bitten Louie on
many occasions, most annoyingly when Louie tried to get into bed or sit
next to his wife, but even though Judy recognized that Manny's behavior
was out of control, she still made excuses for him and continued to
indulge her beloved Poodle. The other dogs in the household were living
under constant stress from the fighting, and Louie worried that one day
all the dogs would end up getting seriously hurt.

Louie told me that this pint-sized dog had fundamentally changed the
relationship between him and his wife, primarily due to his anger over
Judy's steadfast refusal to ever discipline Manny for his bad behavior.
Any time Louie tried to discipline the dog, it led to an argument. Judy
claimed that Louie was simply jealous of the attention she gave Manny.
Louie told me that he had never wanted a third dog and had even warned
his wife that if she brought another dog into the house she'd have to
name it "Divorce," because it would very likely end their marriage.

When people can't communicate with one another effectively or don't
respect each other's opinions and needs, my job becomes infinitely more
difficult. In these cases, before I can address the often significant
canine problems, I must first try to figure out whether or not all the
members of the household can find a way to work together. Usually I can
achieve this by reminding everyone that the dog has no say in the matter
and that they must act responsibly to do right by the animal. If,
however, one or more members of the family are not committed to having
the dog in the first place, my options as a trainer are severely
limited. Luckily for Manny, Louie was eventually willing to concede that
if we could turn around the behavior, he'd willingly commit to the
process.

Throughout the day I witnessed Manny interact with his family, and it
was clear what an utter tyrant he had become. He
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page169}savagely aggressed any
time Louie approached Judy on the couch or on the bed, and he regularly
fought with Butch, the other male in the household, over primary access
to Judy.

Conflicts in multidog households are very common. Minor disagreements
are normal in canine social relationships and actually prevent violence,
but major conflict can be very damaging and stressful for the entire
family. Fights occur when dogs are in direct competition with each other
over access to a valued resource or space, in response to persistent
bullying, during moments of high arousal (such as when the doorbell
rings or at the beginning of a walk), when an owner shows affection to
one dog and not the other, and when one dog does not respond
appropriately to another's social cues. More often than not, aggression
between dogs is not a case of an upstart challenging for dominance but
rather a dog that cannot tolerate or recognize appropriate signals in
others. The old idea of implementing a social hierarchy in a multidog
household to defuse the conflict just doesn't work.

Witnessing a fight between Manny and Butch was disturbing, but
interestingly enough, even though the fight sounded terrible, both dogs
emerged without a scratch. The snarling and gnashing of teeth, the
growling and grabbing of fur made it look like the dogs were trying to
kill each other, but in reality, both dogs seemed to be fighting
*without* wanting to inflict harm---intentionally restricting the
strength and intensity of their bites. This made the prognosis for a
calmer household much more positive. If either dog had really wanted to
cause harm, not only would they have bitten down hard or grabbed and
held on, but the bites would have been purposefully delivered to parts
of the body that they could disable or damage most severely, such as the
legs, the belly, or the throat. I would have been a lot more concerned
about their future lives together if this had been the case. I have been
in many households where dogs will fight to the death, and in such
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page170}situations the prospect
of rehoming one of them becomes a reality. There are some dogs that are
just not meant to live together, and their lives can be made much better
by moving them to different households. It's not fair to make dogs that
hate one another live together; the daily stress each dog experiences
makes life miserable for both (and usually for the owners, too).

I advised Judy to leave Manny on the floor because even the act of
picking him up made Butch angry. To build trust between the dogs and
teach them restraint, Judy and Louie had to become more confident
leaders in their household so that all the dogs could look to them for
direction. If either dog showed signs of arousal, the offender was
quietly removed for a brief time-out to calm down. All the dogs were
taught new cues, including a recall and "settle" cue, so that they could
be called away from their resources and directed to their specific areas
for quiet time. They were also rewarded for practicing avoidance
behaviors such as turning their heads and walking away from each other
or backing down from a highly charged situation. The dogs were taught to
follow the couple whenever they were asked---which worked well to lessen
arousal levels---as well as to take turns receiving affection. While
Butch was petted, Manny was placed in a "settle" until it was his turn.
If tension built between them, Judy walked away from the scene, leaving
the dogs by themselves. With the source of conflict gone, the dogs had
nothing to fight over. If a fight did occur, Judy got up and left the
fight, blowing a loud whistle that stopped the dogs in their tracks.

If disagreements are severe and stress levels are too high in an
emotionally charged environment such as the home, both dogs should be
taken to neutral territory where space and a new environment will allow
them to learn. Giving both dogs activities in each other's presence as
well as taking them for walks or doing agility training side by side
helps them concentrate on doing
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page171}something more positive
while building up a better association with each other.

Although dogs that fight do need to be separated for safety, especially
when they cannot be actively supervised, separation can also make things
worse. Barriers between two dogs cause frustration, and restraining them
on leashes while they are together can also exacerbate a tense
situation, yet it is still vital to give each dog space and make them
feel safe.

People often ask me how to break up a dog fight safely, but there is no
clear answer because it all depends on the specific situation. I advise
owners to avoid getting between two fighting dogs because of the risk of
getting bitten and the prospect of making the situation worse, but when
a fight happens, there is usually so much frantic confusion that people
often forget and dive right in. Trying to restrain one or both dogs puts
you at risk of becoming a target of redirected aggression because
restraining a frenzied dog makes that dog feel vulnerable to attack.
Imagine if someone threatening came toward you while another person held
your arms back so that you couldn't defend yourself. You would probably
try to get free of that person holding your arms so you could protect
yourself. This is exactly the situation you put your dog in when you
restrain him during a conflict. A safer way to break up a fight is to
place some furniture, like a chair, between fighting dogs or to throw a
coat, blanket, or sweater over their eyes. I once broke up a fight
between two Pit Bulls that were hanging onto each other and refusing to
let go. The only way I could get them to release was to throw my coat
over their eyes, cutting off their vision. As soon as they couldn't see
each other, they gave up the fight.

It's very common for dogs to protect their owners, as they naturally
gravitate toward and want to protect those people who make them feel
good. Manny saw the other dogs in the household and Louie as competition
for Judy's attention. The family had
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page172}previously consulted with
a trainer, who had told them (of course!) that Manny was displaying
dominance and wanted to establish himself as the head of the household.
The resulting punitive treatment had only made the situation worse by
amplifying the need to compete, which encouraged more conflict. There
was no question that Manny was controlling environment and movement to
control access to what was important to him---Judy---but he was doing so
not to achieve a higher status but out of fear of losing her attention.
Because Judy had reinforced his aggressive behavior by picking him up
and cuddling him after he had aggressed, Manny had learned that
aggressing brought him much-needed relief with her attention. That made
her even more valuable to him and made Manny increasingly dependent on
her.

My aim was to teach Manny valuable impulse control skills as well as
improve his relationship with Louie. I wanted to show Manny that Louie's
approach wasn't a threat and that there would be negative consequences
if he aggressed. I knew that if Manny's aggressing meant he was removed
from Judy (the very person he wanted to be close to), he would think
twice about reacting in a negative manner. We began teaching in the
bedroom because it was the most volatile place in the home. Judy lay on
the bed with Manny, while I placed a canvas-covered crate on the floor
next to her. I then asked Louie to approach his wife. As soon as Manny
showed a hint of negative reaction, Judy picked him up and gently
lowered him into the crate, closing the top over him. Because the dogs
were never crated in this household, I wasn't concerned that Manny would
build a negative association with it. I also knew that if Judy put him
off the bed and onto the floor without confining him, he would most
likely charge at Louie and bite him.

Each time Louie approached the bed, Manny geared up to attack, but
before he could explode he was quietly lifted into the crate and
ignored. Once he was calm, he was lifted out of the
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page173}crate and placed back on
the bed next to Judy. After about five repetitions, Manny's responses
weakened, until Louie was able to approach without a reaction. The
reward for a calm response was a food reward from Louie and praise and
cuddles from Judy.

Following this breakthrough, we were able to progress quickly to the
next level. Louie approached, handed Judy a glass of water and the
remote control, and finally sat on the side of the bed next to his wife
and dog for the first time ever. In a short period of time Manny had
gone from a reactive, explosive dog to one that eagerly welcomed Louie's
approach. The couple continued to reinforce this success, keeping the
other dogs out of the bedroom until Manny was consistently welcoming.
Louie was to reward Manny with treats intermittently so that the food
reward could gradually be phased out, at which stage the other dogs
would be reintroduced to the bedroom.

Judy and Louie worked hard with their dogs and reaped the rewards of a
calmer household. Now, instead of always being with his beloved Judy,
Manny was actively choosing at times to lie next to Louie---a huge step.
He was finally able to relax and become a happy, confident member of the
family---and fortunately for everyone, "Divorce" was never mentioned
again.

## The Dangers of Flooding {.section}

Cooper was a two-year-old male Boxer that aggressed severely toward
other dogs. His owners, Dannee and Camille, had tried many different
methods to modify Cooper's behavior, but his response got worse and
worse. He lunged toward any dog that walked past him and on two
occasions broke free from his leash and attacked. Dannee and Camille
told me that his behavior was very different when he attended doggy day
care. Cooper never []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page174}fought
with the dogs at day care and seemed to be relaxed and happy at the
facility.

During my first visit I asked if we could go to the day care facility to
see how Cooper interacted with the other dogs around him. I'm really
glad I did, because I could tell right away that even though the staff
assured me he enjoyed being there, I could tell that Cooper was
extremely uncomfortable in that environment.

When Dannee and Camille first adopted Cooper he had actively played with
other dogs in the neighborhood, but his originally easygoing demeanor
changed almost overnight, and no one knew why. A medical investigation
revealed that pain from an earlier leg injury might have been the cause,
but I had a feeling that contrary to what we had been told, all was not
well at day care. Even though some members of staff told Dannee and
Camille that Cooper was never a problem, I did some nosing around and
heard a different story. Cooper regularly ended up in time-outs for
"being a bully." Watching him at day care, I could see how an untrained
eye could have mistakenly assumed that he was coping well---it appeared
that Cooper behaved better at day care than he did at home. My
suspicions were confirmed, however, within the first ten seconds of
viewing him in the dog room. Cooper panted and drooled as he paced up
and down the room, staying close to known exits. He was so overwhelmed
that he seemed to be having a complete internal meltdown, unable to
display his true emotions and shutting down completely. Cooper was being
flooded by what he feared.

Flooding is a behavioral therapy that is sometimes used to "cure" people
or animals of certain fears and phobias. For example, flooding is
regularly used to "cure" dog-aggressive dogs like Cooper by putting the
dog into an enclosure with multiple strange dogs of all ages, breeds,
and sizes. The idea is that even though the aggressive dog will
initially be very anxious when surrounded
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page175}by what he fears, his
body cannot stay in this fearful state forever and he will eventually
calm down. The desired result is that the stimuli or situation that the
dog previously feared no longer arouses anxiety and he learns to
associate a feeling of calm with the stimuli or situation. This change
is expected to help him learn to change his own behavior to avoid
negative consequences while realizing that no harm would come to him
even in the presence of other dogs.

In some cases flooding works, but this therapy is controversial because
the likelihood of failure is so high. Most dogs that are subjected to
this experience are so terrified that not only do their brains shut
down, but they are also rendered unable to learn. They walk around in a
state of fear, trying to survive by avoiding threat and inhibiting their
desire to lash out until their body gives up and they completely
surrender. To the untrained human eye, it looks like a previously
dog-aggressive dog has been rehabilitated and that the desire to aggress
at other dogs has been eliminated.

Unfortunately, most dogs shut down in order to survive until they are
released from the enclosure. Some might reach the point where they feel
more relaxed while avoiding conflict and learning to show
survival-ensuring deference behaviors to those that are more
threatening. The problem is, when these dogs finally come out of the
enclosure, they revert back to aggressing again.

Even though Cooper was uncomfortable in day care, he had learned to cope
by suppressing what he truly felt. He had had a few altercations after
mounting other dogs, but he knew when he was outnumbered. This indoor
day care environment, however, didn't translate to life outside.
Released from his flooding experience, he felt profound relief, and as
soon as he left the facility, he aggressed again at other dogs walking
by. For a flooding therapy to have a better chance of success, the dog
has to be put in a similar situation in all environments and situations,
which is virtually impossible.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page176}That was Cooper's last
day at day care. Taking him away from that environment and teaching him
to be confident with other dogs outside was more important than any
physical benefit he got from being at day care.

Whether flooding is used as a behavioral therapy or a dog is
unintentionally exposed to an environment that floods his senses, it's
important to understand the dynamics of this process and the potential
positive or negative effects on the dog. A dog that attacks other dogs,
whether on or off the leash in public, is very unlikely to be
comfortable around other dogs in a day care environment, even if it
looks like he is behaving normally.

## Unchain Me! The Dangers of Tethering {.section}

Chaining or tethering dogs is a common practice in the United States,
due to the common lack of fencing between properties. Even though tying
a dog to a stationary object in the front yard or backyard enables the
dog to be under control outside without owner supervision, a study by
the American Veterinary Medical Association in 2000 reported that 17
percent of fatal attacks on humans between 1979 and 1998 were from dogs
that were restrained on their property by a tether at the time of the
attack.[^6^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts6){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts6a
.hlink} Many of the victims were children who wandered up to the chained
dogs to say hello and died as a result.

Tethered dogs are more likely than nontethered dogs to respond
aggressively to an approaching person, even if that person is someone
the dog knows, because chaining or tethering a dog for long periods of
time causes immense frustration, excessive agitation, and increased
anxiety and exacerbates the dog's aggressive
response.[^7^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts7){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts7a
.hlink} Owners of these dogs seem unaware of the effects of continual
confinement.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page177}Five-year-old Cheyenne
Peppers was killed by her family's three Pit Bulls as she jumped on her
trampoline. Two of the dogs had spent the day tied up in the yard as the
adults and their friends drove their four wheelers around the property
(an activity that aroused the chained dogs), while the third dog---a
pregnant female---lay close by. After hours of fun, the family went
inside for lunch. Little Cheyenne came out on her own to jump on the
trampoline. It's believed that the pregnant female started the attack
and the other dogs broke free from their tethers and joined in. The
wounds on Cheyenne's body were consistent with predation and dissection.
Her body had been pulled apart.

I cite this case not because these dogs were Pit Bulls. Fatalities,
maulings, and bites happen with all breeds, and any dog, regardless of
breed, that is tethered for long periods can explode. When a dog is
chained on a property or confined with an electric or "invisible" fence,
the property is still accessible to the general public---particularly to
a child who may not be able to resist touching or sometimes teasing the
dog. A scared or angry dog, unable to increase the distance between
himself and an approaching stranger, feels he has no other option but to
fight. Tethered dogs and dogs that live within the boundary of an
electric "invisible" fence are also at the mercy of other animals and
people that may wander onto their territory. There are numerous reports
of dogs that have been stolen from these premises only to be resold and
used as bait for dog fighting or as specimens for laboratory research.

Tethered dogs have limited ability to defend themselves and are at
greater risk of suffering injuries after becoming tangled in their
tethers. Chained dogs often pace constantly to keep themselves
stimulated and are forced to lie close to where they urinate and
defecate. Owners who tether their dogs are also often neglectful,
providing limited food, water, and shelter and leaving their
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page178}dogs out in all types of
weather. Because dogs are naturally social animals, lack of social
interaction can seriously damage a dog's psychological well-being,
particularly if that dog spends long periods of time by himself at the
end of a chain. Dogs living in this restricted torment with limited
interaction experience a build-up of frustration and anger that can
explode at the slightest trigger.

## Electric or Invisible Fences {.section}

I was driving my daughter home from school one afternoon when a Cocker
Spaniel ran out in front of my car. Fortunately I was able to avoid
disaster, but the experience left my daughter and me very shaken. The
dog's owner came running out of the house, reprimanding her dog and
apologizing for his disobedience. She explained that an electric fence
had recently been installed but her dog kept escaping even though he was
wearing his collar and the fence was activated.

I am vehemently against the use of electric shock to train dogs in any
scenario. I have rehabilitated countless dogs that have been physically
hurt or emotionally scarred from shock training, and the experience with
the Spaniel proved to me yet again how grossly inhumane and dangerous
this method is. Whose fault would it have been if I had hit the dog, or
if my daughter and I had been hurt or even killed trying to avoid him?
Not mine, because thankfully I was driving safely and under the speed
limit. I wouldn't necessarily blame the owner either, who, like millions
of Americans, believe that these electric containment systems are a good
idea. No, the blame should stand squarely on the shoulders of the
electric fence companies who put dogs and people at risk every day by
claiming that their products are safe and effective.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page179}An electric fence is a
wireless, in-ground or "invisible" fence that is installed around the
perimeter of a property, creating an invisible boundary. A dog contained
within the boundary of the fence wears a "shock," "remote," or "e-"
collar around his neck (and sometimes around his groin or at the base of
the tail) that consists of a transmitter designed to deliver a "static
correction" should the dog stray too close to the boundary. Flags are
placed at intervals around the perimeter as visual markers. When dogs
first learn to stay within the fence they inevitably receive a series of
electric shocks, which supporters of these fences claim are harmless. Of
course any kind of aversive such as shock has to be relatively strong in
order to be effective and while the dog may learn to quickly associate
one flag or part of the property as a no-go area, his natural curiosity
will inevitably lead to subsequent shocks should he get too close to
other untested areas during the "learning" process.

The transmitter emits an auditory signal or tone which is usually heard
by the dog as he moves closer to the boundary and signals that a shock
is imminent if he proceeds. In order to avoid discomfort and pain the
dog must retreat to within the safety zones of the area when he hears
the tone. Electric fence companies conveniently ignore the simple fact
that because dogs make an association between the tone and the shock,
just hearing the tone makes them anxious. Other dogs are so traumatized
after just one shock experience that a fear memory is imprinted on the
brain forever. I am saddened by the dogs I've seen who now refuse to go
into their yards or have suffered electrical burns from the collars the
fence companies claim are "safe and humane." The case against electronic
containment systems is even stronger when you consider how many dogs
break through the boundary to get to something on the other side
regardless of the pain they experience or because the fence has
malfunctioned in some way,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page180}just like the Spaniel had
done. Many of these dogs end up getting lost, run over, or picked up by
Animal Control workers who regularly find these dogs wandering around
the neighborhood.

Dogs contained behind electric fences tend to become more reactive and
in some cases more aggressive toward strangers and even family members.
A recent study found that dogs without previous aggression problems
attacked family members when the system was
activated.[^8^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts8){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts8a
.hlink} Similarly, delivery people or guests can be unwilling victims of
a dog's pent-up frustration. Any dog left outside for long periods of
time is likely to develop a fence-running habit---barking at cars,
people, or other animals as they go by---but this behavior is a lot more
prevalent in dogs with an uninterrupted view. Fence running is an
unhealthy activity that exacerbates frustration, irritation, and
aggression and regularly becomes a fixed action pattern the dog performs
in other contexts and environments, such as on a walk. I now avoid
walking my dogs in certain areas of my neighborhood because while I
might understand and hope that the poor animals charging towards us stay
within their invisible boundary, my dogs are terrified by what looks to
be an impending attack. Dogs that live within the confines of an
electric fence are also at the mercy of other animals and people who may
wander onto their property, and with no visible boundary, these dogs are
at greater risk of being stolen. Pedigrees have a high resale value
while mixed breeds are regularly stolen and used as bait in dog fighting
or for medical research.

While no fence can offer 100 percent protection, a solid fence will do a
much better job of keeping your dog in his yard and others out. Electric
fence companies would like you to believe that their "fences" are the
perfect solution for containing your dog, offering "safety, comfort, and
peace of mind," but don't be fooled by clever marketing. While the idea
of allowing your dog to experience more unsupervised "freedom" might be
an attractive one []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page181}for
you, the simple truth is that electric fences rely on pain to deter dogs
from escaping, and the risks of anxiety and aggression issues, theft,
and increased legal liability are too high (although companies are very
quiet when it comes to talking about the negative aspects of their
products!). If you don't have a physical fence around your property,
keep your dog inside your home and take him out for regular toilet
breaks and walks or invest in a solid fence around (or smaller "dog run"
within) your property. It is a much safer and more humane and effective
containment option than an electric fence will ever be.

## Assessing a Dog Bite {.section}

If your dog has ever bitten in any circumstance, it is vital to find the
cause and manage the situation so that you never put your dog in the
position where he could bite again. This is easier said than done,
especially for dogs that are serial biters, but your number one priority
should be to keep other people and animals safe by managing your dog's
environment 100 percent of the time.

Many people are bitten because they don't understand canine body
language and misinterpret a dog's signals and intentions. This was
publicly demonstrated by a notorious bite incident on live television.
An Argentinian Mastiff (Dogo Argentino) named Max had been brought onto
a Denver-area morning news show the day after he had been pulled from a
freezing reservoir. The big dog sat by his owner and the fireman who had
rescued him while veteran news anchor and longtime animal lover Kyle
Dyer conducted the interview crouched next to Max, massaging his face.
Throughout the segment Max gave Dyer many signals to back away,
including averting his eyes, turning his head away, showing his teeth,
licking his lips, and yawning, all of which demonstrated that he was
stressed by her close proximity and handling. Dyer,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page182}however, through no fault
of her own, didn't understand the clear signals Max was giving, and as
she leaned in to give him a kiss, he bit her in the face. Dyer underwent
two reconstructive surgeries, a skin graft, and ninety stitches to
repair the damage done to her lip.

The story grabbed headlines throughout the United States because it so
perfectly illustrated what people should never do around dogs,
particularly those they do not know. What was also interesting about
this case was *how* Max delivered the bite. Even though he caused a lot
of damage, the quick contact he made with Dyer's face followed by an
immediate release was an inhibited bite with the intention to increase
distance and not to disable. If Max had really wanted to harm Dyer he
could have taken her face off. It may sound strange to say that this
bite was inhibited when so much damage was done, but a quick bite and
release from a large dog like Max can still do a lot of harm,
particularly on such a tender part of the body. If Max had intended to
harm her more significantly, he could have applied more pressure to her
face and bitten down harder. He might even have gone to the next level:
to hold onto her face and shake it.

I agreed that Max should not be euthanized because he wasn't a danger to
society. The poor dog had suffered major trauma just one day earlier and
was put in a compromised position during the interview with no means of
escape. Even though Max signaled his distress, his language went
unrecognized, and he used the only option he had left. In a later
interview Dyer spoke about the incident, saying that she had always
considered herself a "dog person." She had lived with dogs all her life
and had assumed that Max was enjoying being stroked and massaged. To her
credit, even after suffering a horrific facial injury, Dyer acknowledged
that it was a freak accident, that she was ultimately to blame for being
too close, and that although many of us think we know what dogs are
saying, it's clear that many times we do not. Good dog trainers do
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page183}know, which is why I
respect Dyer so much for helping us spread this important knowledge.

Because of the care I take when working with aggressive dogs, I have
never had my skin punctured by a bite. Aggressive dogs are under stress,
so I work gently and carefully with them. It may not always make for the
sexiest television, but you will never see me fight or grapple an
aggressive dog into submission. If a dog I was working with were to bite
me or anyone else, it would be a massive failure on my part because it
would mean I had lost the dog's trust and respect, and (more important)
the biting behavior would become even more ingrained thanks to that
experience, putting owners and the general public at greater risk of
being bitten. Perhaps that's why some people mistakenly think that I
don't work with aggressive dogs on my show---because they never see me
battle a dog into submission. Sadly, I recognize that it may be
impressive for some to watch a trainer dominate a dog while getting
bitten in the process. These kinds of trainers show the scars from their
previous canine battles like some sort of badge of honor, but for those
of us who know how much stress these dogs are being put through during
the "training" process, and understand the increased likelihood for them
to bite again following such a traumatic experience, it is the height of
ignorance and irresponsibility.

## Vicious Dog Attacks and Fatalities {.section}

On February 28, 2010, Ashlynn Anderson was playing in her backyard when
she was fatally attacked by her stepfather's dog. Ashlynn sustained
severe injuries to her throat and later died in the hospital. The dog
was quickly euthanized, and the resulting investigation classified the
death as a tragic accident. Ashlynn's parents and grandparents live in
torment over the loss of their beloved
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page184}child, in part because it
was a tragedy that could have been prevented. Even though attacks of
this nature are rare in proportion to the number of owned dogs in this
country, one fatality like this is one too many.

As a mother and a dog trainer I am dedicated to raising awareness about
responsible pet ownership and prevention of dog bites. My public
platforms allow me to shine a spotlight on the issue, and members of my
Dog Bite Prevention Task Force (composed of veterinarians, lawyers,
canine bite investigators, and pediatric surgeons) are each doing what
they can to educate the public about how to be safe around dogs. In
addition to working on much-needed national campaigns with the Task
Force, I spend a lot of my free time teaching bite prevention to
children. As the canine population continues to grow, so have the number
of dog bites both in Britain and the United States. Over the ten-year
period ending in 2012, the number of reported dog bites requiring
medical treatment increased by 50 percent in England and 150 percent in
Scotland.[^9^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts9){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts9a
.hlink} According to a report by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality, the number of hospital admissions caused by dog bites in
the United States nearly doubled over a sixteen-year period, increasing
from 5,100 in 1993 to 9,500 in
2008.[^10^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts10){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts10a
.hlink} And as if these numbers weren't bad enough, according to 2010
statistics, there were approximately 4.5 million reported dog bites in
the United States, 800,000 of which were serious enough to require
medical
attention.[^11^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts11){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts11a
.hlink}

Even though statistics can be misleading, there is no question that
hospital admissions from dog bites are increasing. This is alarming but
not altogether surprising, considering how popular dogs have become. For
the first time, according to the latest census, dogs outnumber children
in American
households.[^12^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts12){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts12a
.hlink} Most of these dogs are privileged members of the family with
nothing more to do than lie on the couch all day. Unfortunately,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page185}more "unemployed" dogs
means more bored animals who consequently suffer stress and anxiety.
Most dogs receive no formal training, but for those that are taken to
class and are trained using punitive, outdated methods, an increase in
negative behavior is often the result.

Several other factors are exacerbating the dog bite problem, and first
among these are the poor breeding practices used by the puppy mill
industry and backyard breeders. Puppy farmers care very little for the
well-being of the dogs they breed; they are more interested in simply
making money by churning out puppies, with no attempt to breed for good
temperament and no effort to socialize their puppies with humans or
other animals. Such lack of socialization causes fear and
insecurity---leading causes of aggressive behavior. A large portion of
the blame for these incidents rests with the irresponsible owners who
use their large breed dogs for protection and intimidation without
adequately socializing them. Finally, intact male dogs make up a
significant majority of the pool of dogs who have attacked in the
past---yet another reason why intransigent owners should overcome their
reluctance to have their dogs neutered.

Contrary to the reports that usually accompany these incidents, the
majority of such attacks do not come out of the blue. There are a
plethora of markers and flags before an attack occurs that go unnoticed
or are ignored. In many cases dogs that have attacked viciously have
been actively encouraged to be aggressive by their owners. This is one
of many reasons why I do not agree with breed-specific
legislation---that is, laws that restrict or ban ownership of certain
breeds of dogs, like the Pit Bull Terrier. I am well aware that the
majority of serious attacks come from large breeds, but I am also
acutely aware that for all the reasons just detailed, the majority of
these attacks could have been prevented if owners took more
responsibility for the care and welfare of
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page186}their dogs. What's more,
any breed of dog can bite and cause significant damage (especially to
vulnerable parts of the body), just as any breed of dog can make a good
family pet.

While investigating the more serious maulings and dog-related
fatalities, I started to notice a trend. Many of the attacks,
particularly on children, came from dogs that were known to the children
but did not live with them full time. The child victim was very often
found to be either visiting an extended family member or living between
two parents, as was the case with little Ashlynn. Sometimes the dog was
staying with the victim's family while the owners were away. The
frequency of this unfamiliar-dog-or-child trigger in fatal dog attacks
must be accounted for by our society as we develop greater awareness
about how potentially dangerous dogs are likely to react when placed
near unfamiliar people or in unfamiliar environments.

Most attacks on infants occur within a few months of birth or when the
parent or guardian leaves their infant in an area the dog values, such
as the parents' bed that at one time had also been shared by the dog.
Many dogs that kill also have a history of aggressive response and high
prey drive. I understand why people want to euthanize these dogs so
quickly after an attack, but I also think it's important that canine
behavior professionals are brought in to investigate the circumstances
of these fatalities. Such quick euthanasia eliminates the most critical
piece of evidence from the event, which might otherwise have provided
valuable insight into why the attack occurred. Only by understanding
how, when, where, and why these attacks happen can we increase our
chances as a society of saving lives in the future.

Jim Crosby, a former canine police officer, certified behavior
consultant, and canine aggression expert, has regularly consulted on
serious attacks and has examined many dogs that have killed people.
According to Crosby, the rising bite numbers indicate that
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page187}a large part of this
problem lies with those irresponsible owners who choose not to spay and
neuter, who chain their animals outside for extended periods, and who
ultimately care less about their animals than they should. I
wholeheartedly agree when he says that, more often than not, it's the
two-legged animals more often than the four-legged ones that precipitate
the
problem.[^13^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts13){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts13a
.hlink}

These deaths are extremely rare, but dog bites are not. The Humane
Society of the United States reports that 50 percent of children will be
bitten by a dog before their twelfth
birthday.[^14^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts14){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts14a
.hlink} Children under the age of five are most likely to be bitten, and
most of these bites come from a dog that the child knows (usually the
family dog or that of a relative or friend). Children are most likely to
be bitten in the face, as they are closer to a dog's eye level, making
it easier for a dog to feel threatened by eye-to-eye contact. Children
love to kiss and hug dogs, even though these expressions of affection do
not translate well in the dog world. Fast movements can also stimulate a
dog's prey drive and/or chase instinct, and higher-pitched voices can
sometimes startle a dog and make him fearful. A dog can be frustrated by
rough play or by teasing, and a child can inadvertently inflict pain by
pulling a tail or poking an eye. It is also hard for children to read
and understand a dog's body language, so they miss vital signals that
could alert them to get out of harm's way. Parents and guardians also
frequently miss these signals, but even in some cases where the grownups
are aware of their dog's aggressive history, little is done to address
the dog's behavior. Most people simply believe that such tragedies will
never happen to them.

The only way to keep young children completely safe around dogs is for
parents and guardians to be responsible for their dogs at all times and
to teach their children how to behave not just with their dog, but also
around other dogs with whom they might come in contact. An infant or
young child should *never* be
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page188}left unsupervised with
*any* dog at *any* time, and *all* interactions between them need to be
actively supervised. If this isn't possible, the child and dog need to
be safely separated so that no interaction can occur between them.
According to a number of pediatric surgeons I have interviewed, dogs
should never be allowed to sleep with a child, because some of the worst
bites they see happen when a sleeping dog has been awakened suddenly, by
the child either knowingly waking the dog up or accidently rolling into
him while they are
sleeping.[^15^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c09-nts15){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#c09-nts15a
.hlink} All dogs need to receive a humane canine education to help them
live successfully in a domestic situation, and if a dog is showing
worrying behavior, the owner should seek help from a qualified
professional.

As awareness spreads and people take more responsibility for their pets,
one can only hope that the alarming rise in dog bite statistics in the
United States will begin to trend downward. Until this happens, though,
the future doesn't look bright, and more people will find their lives
changed forever because of a bite that in most cases could have been
prevented.

## Assessing Future Risk {.section}

If your dog has bitten and you are worried he will bite again, contact a
positive reinforcement training professional to help you work with the
behavior and assess future risk. Be prepared for a prognosis that may
not be very good if your dog has a long history and very low threshold
for aggressive response, or if bite incidents have become more severe
and frequent. If you cannot successfully redirect your dog's aggressive
response, or the behavior has become more unpredictable and is occurring
in many different situations, you have cause for concern. I am
continually amazed when I see family members living with a dog that
terrifies them just because one member of the household refuses to work
with []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c09_r1.htm#page189}or rehome that dog.
Successful modification for aggressive behavior relies on owner
compliance, and people who are unwilling to work with their dogs
endanger not only their pet's life, but also the lives of those around
them.

If bite injuries cause slight bruising or minimal wounds, if the
behavior has only recently begun, or if a dog has a higher threshold
(which makes an aggressive response more predictable), the chance of
success is higher.

Ultimately, when an owner is dedicated to finding a solution to the
problem using force-free methods, most dogs' aggressive response can be
successfully managed as long as all members of the household are willing
to devote enough time, commitment, and patience to their dog's
rehabilitation.

# SOLVING COMMON BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS  [Stealing, Running Away, Jumping Up, Barking, Leash Pulling, Eating Poop, and Mouthing]{.small1} {.subchapter}

Jumping on people, barking at the mailman, dashing out of the door, and
stealing food are all very common behaviors that pet owners experience
with their canine family members. What dog can resist stealing the
cupcakes off the kitchen counter or suppress the desire to jump on
someone coming through the door? Even if an impulsive act puts a dog in
danger or causes harm to others, impulsive dogs do not consider the
consequences of their physical or emotional behavior.

Just like teenagers, who tend to take more risks and have more emotional
outbursts than adults, puppies and adolescent dogs find it more
difficult to control themselves physically and emotionally. I cannot
overstate the importance of teaching all dogs impulse control from an
early age and encouraging emotional stability, because self-control
often represents the fine line between a dog
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page192}being surrendered to a
shelter or staying in the home. Living with an impulsive dog can be very
frustrating, but fortunately there are powerful positive solutions that
can put an end to many types of annoying behaviors.

## Stealing {.section}

I was contacted recently by a client who had had enough of her dog
stealing food whenever her back was turned. To fix the problem, the lady
had purchased two "scat mats"---electrified mats that she placed on the
kitchen counters to give her dog a shock each time he attempted to jump
up. The dog received such a jolt when he attempted to counter-surf that
he squealed and ran out of the kitchen. The scat mats seemed to have
done the trick, and the lady was pleased with the result, but this
"success" created complications that made it relatively short-lived. The
only entrance to the backyard was through the kitchen, but now, because
the shock the dog had received had been so traumatic, he refused to go
anywhere near the kitchen area and started having toileting accidents
inside the home. A counter-surfing issue had now turned into major
anxiety (and a major mess), and it took a long time before the dog felt
comfortable enough to walk through the kitchen again to get to the
backyard. I wish I had been contacted earlier because there are many
successful nonaversive techniques to stop a dog from stealing food.

Put yourself in your dog's paws and place your favorite food on the
counter when you're hungry. Now walk past and see if you can resist
taking a bite. Most people who have difficulty controlling themselves
around food expect their dogs to somehow resist temptation even when
food is placed right in front of them. It is much more realistic to use
a combination of management and training techniques to make it easy for
your dog to avoid temptation while ensuring her safety. Dogs do not
share our human []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page193}sense of
right and wrong, and if you make the mistake of leaving food on the
counter where a dog can reach it, you are reinforcing her success.
Blocking access to places where food is left out by using baby gates or
putting the dog in another room when you have company means that there
is no opportunity for your dog to fail. If this is not a realistic
option, you can try tethering your dog to you so that she is with you at
all times---or, if you are working in the kitchen and unable to use a
baby gate, draw an imaginary line along the floor and teach your dog to
stay behind that line. To do this, you need to first teach a reliable
stay cue so your dog understands what is expected of her. If she crosses
over the line, gently block her with your body until she goes behind the
line again. If you reward her at intervals while she stays put, she will
see this area as a good place to be.

Because counter surfing happens mostly when a person is not around (dogs
are smart!), you can try catching your dog in the act by following these
easy steps:

::: hanging01
    • Put some food on the counter and then walk away to a place where
you can see the food but your dog thinks she is not being watched.

    • Pick up a magazine or pretend to be doing something else so that
she thinks you're not paying attention to her.

    • Wait for her to go up to the counter, and just before she jumps,
ask her to "leave it."

    • If she backs away, praise her.

    • If she takes the food, calmly remove what is left and repeat the
process, putting the food in a less accessible place to make it harder
for her to reach it. When she is responding well, gradually move the
food back to the previous location.

    • Start this exercise using low-value food before making it more
difficult with the yummy stuff.
:::

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page194}While you're entertaining
guests, give your dog something else to focus on---an interactive toy
such as a treat ball or a rubber toy filled with food. This activity
will most likely tire her out while filling her up and quenching any
desire to seek out more food. In this way, you leave your dog satisfied
and your food safe!

There are obvious dangers when dogs steal food, including the potential
for ingesting plastic wrapping or actual food that could be harmful,
including grapes, raisins, chicken bones, and chocolate. When I was a
child, my grandmother's Beagles ate all my chocolate Easter eggs three
years in a row. Why I didn't learn after the first year to put them out
of harm's way I don't know, but fortunately, even though I missed out on
a few extra calories, the dogs survived their chocolate binges thanks to
numerous trips to the veterinarian. Chocolate contains a substance
called theobromine, an alkaloid of the cacao plant, which can cause
cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, internal bleeding, heart attacks, and
even death. The Beagles were lucky to be alive but continued their
thievery and regularly stole other kinds of food from underneath my
increasingly frustrated grandmother's nose. Once in a while, when they
were caught in the act, a battle royal ensued as my grandmother tried to
get the stolen food out of their mouths. The dogs snarled at her as she
tried in vain to pry open their jaws, and as she got angrier, the dogs
snarled louder. My grandmother inevitably lost the battle for fear of
being bitten, and the dogs skulked away, defensive but victorious. I
wish I'd known then what I know now so that I could have taught my
grandmother a safer and more effective way of getting food from her
dogs!

## []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page195}The Leave It Cue {.section}

Learning basic compliance cues that encourage impulse control is the
first step toward being able to address more significant behavior
issues. If you haven't built up a common language and aren't able to
communicate what you want to your dog, it's silly to assume that she'll
care about or be able to understand what you're asking her to do when
she's jumping, chewing, running away, pulling, or barking.

Because of this, the "leave it" cue is invaluable in many situations.
The "it" in question might be food that has fallen on the floor,
something your dog picks up on a walk, another dog, or even a child.
Here's how you help your dog learn it.

### STAGE ONE {.section}

::: hanging01
    • Hold a piece of food in your fingers, leaving only a little bit
sticking out so that your dog does not have easy access to it.

    • Extend the food toward your dog's nose and let her work out how
she is going to get it out of your hand.

    • She may try smelling, nibbling, or pawing at it, but don't give it
to her until she hesitates momentarily, either by stopping and moving
her nose back or by turning her head away.

    • When she makes any motion to pull himself back, praise her and
give her the food that you have in your hand.

    • Repeat this exercise a couple of times until she consistently
makes the decision to take her nose away from the food.
:::

### STAGE TWO {.section}

::: hanging01
    • Now add the words "leave it" while she is in the act of moving her
head away. This will build up an association between the cue and the
action.

    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page196}Repeat this process
a number of times.

    • Once she is responding reliably, ask her to "leave it" as soon as
you present your hand to her; then reward her for complying.
:::

### STAGE THREE {.section}

Now that you have built up an association with the word and the action,
you can make it harder for your dog.

::: hanging01
    • Put the food on your open palm so that she can see and smell it.

    • Place a food reward in your other hand and hide it behind your
back.

    • Show your dog the food in your open palm and ask her to "leave
it." At this stage it may be harder for your dog to comply because now
she can actually see the treat right in front of her.

    • If she tries to get it, cup your hand over the treat and place
your hand behind you for a few seconds, saying the words "uh-oh" as you
do this. This is called a *no reward marker* and tells your dog that she
will not be rewarded for her noncompliance.

    • If your dog does comply, do not reward her with the treat from the
hand that you have asked her to leave. Give her the food reward that you
are holding in your other hand. At this stage it's essential thats she
never gets the food or object that she has decided to leave, so the
reward now has to come from elsewhere.
:::

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page197}STAGE FOUR {.section}

Up the ante by making it even harder for your dog.

::: hanging01
    • Put the food on a table or the floor.

    • Repeat the process, rewarding your dog with a treat in your hand,
not the one on the table or floor.
:::

### STAGE FIVE {.section}

::: hanging01
    • Put a leash on your dog and walk her past the treat on the floor.

    • If she reaches for it, say "leave it" without jerking the leash,
and praise and reward her for her compliance. If she grabs the treat,
don't try to get it out of her mouth. Go back to the previous stage
where she was successful and build up the cue until she is ready to try
again.
:::

### STAGE SIX {.section}

::: hanging01
    • Keep repeating the exercise by placing other objects on the
floor---preferably the types of things you want her to leave alone. Once
your dog is doing well with this cue inside the home, you can start to
use it outside.
:::

## The Great Escape---Hound Houdinis {.section}

Linda Quinn tearfully described to me how Buddy kept running away. Every
time she opened the front door to let someone in, the Jack Russell
Terrier made his escape, running over the road and into the woods
beyond. The sound of the doorbell always triggered great excitement
because for Buddy this meant freedom! Even if Linda held onto him, he
wriggled out of her grip like a slippery eel and dashed out the door
like a rocket.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page198}As I approached the
house, I braced myself to catch him, but he was too quick for me, and I
joined Linda in the chase before Buddy disappeared into the woods. I
make it a rule never to run after a dog if it runs away because doing so
only makes the dog run faster, but in this circumstance we had to get
Buddy back before he was hurt. Linda finally cornered him and carried
him home. "At least," she gasped, "he keeps me fit."

Door dashing is a very common behavior with obviously dangerous
consequences. Buddy was lucky that he had escaped injury thus far, but
it was only a matter of time before he got seriously hurt, and Linda
desperately needed help to get his dangerous habit under control.

The first step when teaching a dog not to escape is to find out why she
wants to run away in the first place. Escaping not only relieves a dog's
boredom but allows dogs with high prey drive to fulfill their
deep-rooted need to seek out prey. Buddy was walked three times a day,
but because the family didn't have a fenced-in yard, he was never off
leash outside. The nature of his walk was whimsically determined by
whichever direction the family wanted to take and the pace at which they
wanted to walk, so he never had the freedom to do what he wanted. Buddy
was living as most domestic dogs do, in a sensory-deprived environment,
so the promise of fun and excitement outside the home was too much for
him to ignore. Escaping made him feel good.

It was time to teach Buddy some impulse control. He was a relatively
young dog who had boundless energy but had never been taught how to
self-inhibit and couldn't stay still in one place unless he was
sleeping. Teaching him the "stay" cue in front of an open door was no
easy task. To begin with, I asked Buddy to "stay" by putting my hand up
in front of my body with my palm facing him and holding it there for a
moment before I gave him a food reward for complying. Once I had his
focus, I gradually
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page199}lengthened the time that
my hand was still until I had him staying in one spot for a full two
minutes---a miracle! Then I added the word "stay" and took a step back.
Immediately, Buddy moved to follow me, but I lured him back to his
original waiting place and repeated the exercise. This time Buddy stayed
in one place and did not move a muscle until I released him---a
testament to how intent he was on getting his reward. After a few more
repetitions and gradually increased distance, I was able to walk to the
door.

The real test came when I put my hand on the door handle and rattled it,
a physical and auditory cue that the door was about to be opened, but
Buddy never moved. He was doing so well that I was able to progress
quickly to the next level, which involved opening the door a tiny crack
and then widening it until the front door was completely open. Buddy
soon learned that the decision he made to stay in one place would be
rewarded, and because he loved food, his reward was thankfully more
motivating for him than running away.

I then added the trigger that signaled a door dashing opportunity was
imminent---the doorbell. It's one thing for a dog to sit and wait by a
door during a calm teaching session, but quite another to use
self-control after the doorbell has rung, seemingly out of the blue. As
soon as Buddy heard the doorbell ring he ran to the door and barked
excitedly. Saying nothing, I waited patiently for a moment of calm,
lured him back to his spot, and then asked him to stay. The reward for
his compliance was twofold---food and the opportunity to greet whoever
came through the door.

In addition to impulse control training and increased outdoor
activities, I made sure Buddy had enough physical and mental stimulation
in the home throughout the day. I encouraged the family to play
hide-and-seek games with him by hiding food around the home and sending
him off to track it down. I set up some tunnels in the kids' playroom so
that he could search for the
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page200}squeaky toys I laid out
for him at intervals "underground." Keeping him entertained in this way
meant that he was much more content to stay indoors.

By the time I left the family, Buddy was staying consistently by the
door when it was opened. It proved to them that even a Terrier could be
taught impulse control around an exciting stimulus. I was confident that
the family would keep reinforcing the teaching so that Buddy would never
feel the temptation to escape again.

## Teaching the Stay Cue {.section}

The "stay" cue teaches a dog impulse control skills and can be used in a
variety of situations, such as at the front door, before crossing a
road, and when people come into your home. Here's how you do it.

### STAGE ONE---BUILDING DURATION {.section}

::: hanging01
    • Start the process by putting your hand in front of you with the
palm facing your dog and hold it there for a few seconds.

    • Reward your dog's attention and stillness with a treat paired with
a reward word (such as the classic "good girl").

    • Repeat the action and add the word "stay" as you put your hand up.

    • Hold it there for a few seconds, then praise your dog, followed by
a food reward.

    • Once you have your dog's focus, gradually lengthen the time that
your hand is still until she is staying in one spot for one minute.
:::

### []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page201}STAGE TWO-ADD DISTANCE {.section}

::: hanging01
    • Ask your dog to stay and take a step back.

    • If your dog moves, lure her back to the original waiting place and
repeat the exercise.

    • If your dog stays in one place, walk back to her and reward with
the verbal praise and a treat.

    • Repeat this process a number of times until your dog is
consistently staying in one place; only then, increase the amount of
steps you take backward until you can walk at least five steps away and
back to her without her moving.
:::

### STAGE THREE---INCREASE DISTANCE {.section}

Repeat the first two steps while gradually increasing distance. Don't go
too far too fast, but if your dog is responding well, you can make the
distance as far as you want. If she breaks her stay at any point, go
back to the previous distance and build up gradually. At this stage you
are still facing her while backing away.

### STAGE FOUR---VARY YOUR BODY POSITION {.section}

Dogs like to follow us when we walk away from them, so as soon as you
ask your dog to stay and turn your back on her, she is likely to forget
everything she has learned and follow you. That is why it is important
to practice the "stay" by turning your body and walking away from your
dog as well as walking to her side or around her in a circle.

### STAGE FIVE---PROOFING THE STAY CUE {.section}

Can your dog stay in one place while toys are being thrown around her,
when people run past, when the doorbell rings, or if you go out of
sight? Verifying all of this is called *proofing* a
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page202}behavior. When any
learned behavior is taken to a more stimulating environment or
situation, it makes it a lot harder for a dog to comply, but every dog
can get to this point with reinforcement.

## Jumping Up {.section}

Most dogs jump on people through sheer excitement and because it is an
effective means of getting attention, but some dogs jump because they
feel uneasy when someone new comes into the home and the action of
jumping is an effective way to cope with that discomfort.

The best way to stop your dog from jumping up is to ignore her while she
is in the act of jumping.

::: hanging01
    • Turn your back on your dog each time she jumps up at you.

    • Do not look at, talk to, or touch her while she is jumping and
fold your arms in front of you so that you become boring.

    • When she stops jumping, wait for three seconds of four paws on the
floor and then reward her with your attention.

    • If she jumps again, repeat the exercise.

    • Practice this with friends and family members as well so that your
dog learns through consistency.
:::

During this training process, you may find that your dog jumps even
higher to get your attention. This is known as an *extinction burst*.
Because the behavior that previously got your attention no longer works,
your dog might try even harder to get what she desires. Be sure to
persevere with the technique at this point, because she will eventually
give up.

If your dog jumps on guests in excitement or as a default behavior to
cope with the discomfort she feels, manage your environment by putting
her in another room or keeping her behind a baby gate until she is calm.
Then walk her up to your guests and
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page203}teach her to greet
appropriately by sitting in front of them instead of jumping. This
channels her energy by giving her something to do while greeting, and a
dog that is sitting cannot jump up---a development your guests will
surely appreciate!

## Barking {.section}

I left the house with my ears ringing, relieved to be outside in the
relative calm of a hot summer day. Cars roared by as I stood on the side
of the busy main road, but the noise was nothing compared to what I had
just experienced. I looked at the handheld decibel meter (a device that
measures the level of noise) I was carrying, not believing what I had
heard and seen. The readings had gone off the charts, peaking at over
110 decibels---as loud as a jet plane taking off or a jackhammer digging
next to a person's ear. One minute of exposure to that level of noise
causes hearing damage, and fifteen minutes of continual exposure causes
permanent hearing loss. I had been in the home for over an hour and felt
like I had just emerged from a rock concert.

Barking is not only an important method of communication but also an
expression and measure of a dog's emotional state. Dogs that bark
excessively cause big problems for their owners and their
neighbors---problems so severe that occasionally people resort to
drastic measures such as devocalizing (surgically removing part of a
dog's vocal cords---commonly called *debarking*). The idea of
devocalizing is appalling to most people, but the surgery is performed
more than veterinarians would like to admit. The couple I had just met
were seriously considering this option for their four dogs.

Because humans like quick fixes, modern-day technology has unfortunately
provided them with various electronic tools to suppress barking
behavior. Antibark collars that emit a shock, spray,
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page204}or uncomfortable auditory
tone each time a dog barks promise quick solutions to a nuisance
behavior, but of course, as with all such devices, they never address
the reason why the dog is barking in the first place. Even beyond the
issue of inhumane treatment, this means they also don't work very well.
Because barking is so closely linked to emotion, suppressing the
behavior with these devices or punishing the dog in a harsh and forceful
way may suppress the act of barking for a period of time, but it serves
only to make the underlying emotion even stronger and more resistant to
change. I have seen clients in multidog households use antibark collars
on one of their dogs, only to find that if another dog barks near the
dog wearing the collar, the collared dog will get a spray in the face
even though she never uttered a sound. Other clients have observed that
their dogs learned to ignore the spray, barking until the spray
reservoir was empty.

Dogs bark for many reasons, including but not limited to the following:

::: hanging01
    • To warn others that something or someone is approaching

    • To identify who they are

    • In response to other dogs that they see or hear

    • To establish social contact

    • To demand something from a person or another dog

    • As an expression of fear, anxiety, or stress

    • To relieve boredom or frustration

    • As an expression of excitement

    • During play

    • To warn a perceived threat to back away
:::

Understanding why dogs bark can help you modify a behavior that might
otherwise become a significant nuisance. Watching how a dog barks by
observing her body language helps identify
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page205}the cause; the pitch and
intensity of a bark reflects intention and emotional state. If a dog is
anxious or stressed, the bark tends to be more repetitive and
high-pitched, increasing in pitch and speed as the dog gets more
anxious, just as we raise our voices when we are stressed. The body is
usually very tense. A warning bark tends to be slower and lower in
pitch, with a taut body that leans forward in a defensive posture. A dog
that is barking through boredom tends to bark with the same tone for
long periods.

Whatever the reason, if your dog's barking has become excessive, finding
the cause is the first step in determining the best way to modify it. In
general, the best prescription for most barking issues---regardless of
the cause---is increased exercise and mental stimulation, which helps
refocus a dog's mind and tire her out. The modern dog leads a relatively
unstimulating life in the domestic home, with nothing more to do than
eat two meals a day, sleep on the couch, and go for the occasional walk.
This is especially hard on working breeds, which are particularly likely
to bark to relieve their boredom.

The house I had just emerged from belonged to Jessie and JoAnn, who
volunteered for a local rescue group and had adopted their four dogs
over the course of a year. Because they both had busy lives and
exhausting work schedules, the dogs spent most of their day locked up in
crates, so boredom and frustration was taking its toll on all of them. I
had to question the couple's decision to adopt so many dogs when they
had so little time to give them, but these dogs had been on death row
and it was a decision that had to be made quickly. Having lived with the
noise for so long, Jessie was now hard of hearing, particularly in his
right ear. He had threatened to move out if the situation didn't
improve. JoAnn had talked Jessie into the adoptions, but it was a
decision that he was now regretting. She refused to rehome any of her
dogs and told her husband that if she had to choose between him and the
dogs, []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page206}she would choose
the dogs. For a couple that had been married a little over two years,
this was a sad state of affairs.

Bailey---an energetic but anxious Pit Bull mix---had been the first to
arrive, and because of a past history of abuse, he formed an almost
desperate attachment to his owners. He needed continual attention and
barked until he got it. In fact, it was probably Bailey that had caused
the hearing loss in his owner's right ear, because his crate was located
to the right of Jessie's chair in the living room. The couple had
inadvertently made Bailey's barking worse by shouting at him to stop.
However, when I taught them to ignore the barking but reward the quiet
with attention and play time, they saw how effective this technique was.
Bailey quickly learned that he only received his family's attention when
he was quiet.

Some scientists believe that dogs who live together imitate each other's
sound patterns. Whether this is always true or not, it was definitely
the case in this household. All the dogs barked with matching excitement
before going for a walk, which made this training even harder, because
the couple had a fixed pattern of predeparture cues that told the dogs a
walk was imminent long before the leashes were picked up. I advised them
to change their departure cues as much as they could. If the dogs barked
when the couple went to get the leashes, for example, the leashes were
put back and the couple sat down. If they managed to successfully attach
the leashes but barking erupted as the dogs went outside, they
immediately came back in until the dogs were quiet.

This technique worked well in this instance because once one of the dogs
started to bark, the others joined in, but this process can be made more
complicated when only one dog barks while the others remain silent.
Bringing the barking dog back inside while the quiet ones stay outside
is fine if you have two people doing the walking, but if you are by
yourself, this problem becomes a lot
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page207}trickier to deal with. In
such instances, I do this technique with each dog individually, working
the others back into the group once they are consistently being quiet
individually. This requires patience because it means that, at least in
the beginning, the dogs have to be leashed and walked
separately---something that requires time and some good home management.
The beauty of these teaching techniques is that they do not require any
verbal communication with a dog whatsoever. In highly charged situations
like these, shouting at the dog only sounds like you are joining in the
conversation, so body language is much more effective and will do the
talking for you.

Each of the four dogs in this household needed an outlet that was
specifically designed to motivate that dog and serve its particular
needs. Because Bailey loved to play with balls, he was given two
half-hour daily play sessions in the backyard as well as an hour a week
learning the sport of Treibball at a local dog training center. German
Shepherd mix Max loved to chase squirrels and excelled at the sport of
lure coursing. Boston Terrier/Bulldog mix Eve loved to chew and
disembowel toys, but because of a medical condition was unable to
exercise with the others. I gave the couple a selection of dog puzzles
through which Eve could be fed, keeping her engaged and quiet for hours.
She was also taken for daily rides in the car, as she loved to stick her
head out of the window and feel the wind in her ears. Their fourth dog,
Blaze, showed a real talent for finding hidden food and toys; this was
further reinforced at a weekly scent work class that gave him the
perfect outlet and allowed him to socialize with other dogs outside the
home.

One effective method to stop a barking dog is to actually encourage that
dog to bark and then teach her to stop on cue. This is called the
*controlled barking* technique and can be achieved in the following way:

::: hanging01
    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page208}Start by
encouraging your dog to bark. You can use your dog's normal triggers to
do this (ringing the doorbell, for example). Reward your dog while she
is actively barking by giving her a treat or toy.

    • While your dog's mouth is occupied chewing on the treat or by the
toy, say "quiet" paired with a hand signal. If your dog is quiet for
even a few seconds, reward her with another treat or game with the toy.

    • Repeat this process a number of times, rewarding both the barking
and the quiet.

    • After a few repetitions, encourage your dog to bark again, only
this time put a vocal cue to the act of barking, such as "speak," but do
not give her a reward. Ask her to "quiet" and give her the treat or toy
only if she complies. Now being quiet is more reinforcing than barking,
because the quiet is the only behavior that earns the reward.

    • Your dog has now learned two cues. "Speak" means bark and "quiet"
means stop barking. Having both these behaviors on cue will really help
you positively control your dog's barking habit.
:::

All of Jessie and JoAnn's dogs required regular walks, and all of them
were fed through activity toys at mealtimes rather than just from their
bowls. Working for their food stimulated their brains and tired them
out. Complementary therapies---such as soft music from my Canine Noise
Phobia Series' *Calming* CD (see
[Resources](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_res_r1.htm){.hlink}), weekly
massage sessions, and a dog-appeasing pheromone plug-in---helped ease
what had previously been a very stressful environment in which to live.

My experience with this family proved to me that if barking this extreme
could be modified by taking the steps I've described, then any barking
issue can be tackled. Living with a barking dog
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page209}is frustrating, but with
time, thought, and effort, this behavior can be treated successfully
without having to resort to punishment or surgery.

## Leash Pulling {.section}

Contrary to popular belief, dogs that pull on the leash while being
walked do not want to be pack leader, top dog, alpha, or dominant over
their human. There is a much simpler explanation: dogs love to be
outside, and the walk is a stimulating and exciting part of their day,
so the desire to push ahead is very strong. From the dog's point of
view, humans don't make ideal walking partners either because a dog's
natural and comfortable walking pace is generally much faster than ours.
Having to walk calmly by a person's side when the only thing the dog
really wants to do is run and investigate the environment around her
requires a degree of self-control that can be very difficult for some
dogs to master. A leash, though vital for safety, can also be
frustrating, because being "tied" to a person essentially stops a dog's
ability to act naturally. That being said, all dogs should be taught how
to walk on the leash in a positive way without being jerked, yanked,
choked, or shocked, so that walks can be enjoyable for everyone.

If you are overpowered by your dog's pulling and can't start teaching
for fear of being pulled over, there are humane equipment solutions to
help modify the pulling while you teach your dog to walk appropriately.
A chest-led harness is a perfect training aid, as it takes pressure off
a dog's sensitive neck area by distributing the pressure more evenly
around the body. When the leash is attached to a ring located on the
chest strap and your dog pulls, the harness will turn her body around
rather than allowing her to go forward. I recommend this kind of harness
for anyone who needs extra help, because safety must come first. Some
dogs []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page210}are so strong that
they need a canine head collar, which acts the same way a halter does on
a horse. Because the leash is attached to a metal loop located on the
head collar under the dog's chin, the head automatically comes around
when the dog pulls. I use head collars to help in severe cases,
especially when clients are pregnant or elderly, but dogs need time to
habituate to head collars as they can be uncomfortable at first. The
owner must also be careful to prevent the dog from lunging forward; the
dog's head can jerk around suddenly, potentially causing significant
injury to her neck. Avoid the use of choke or prong collars, as these
devices cause pain and significant physical damage to your dog's neck
and
spine.[^1^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c10-nts1){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-nts1a

### THE STOP AND BE STILL TECHNIQUE {.section}

Leash pulling is often successful for the dog because the person
inadvertently reinforces the pulling by allowing the dog to go where she
wants to when she pulls. But you can change this picture by changing the
consequence for your dog. Whenever she pulls, immediately stop and stand
completely still until the leash relaxes, either because your dog has
taken a step back or has turned around to give you focus. When the leash
is nicely relaxed, proceed on your walk. Repeat this as necessary.

### THE REVERSE DIRECTION TECHNIQUE {.section}

If you find the preceding technique too slow, you can try the *reverse
direction* method. When your dog pulls, issue a "let's go" cue, turn
away from her, and walk off in the other direction without jerking on
the leash. You can avoid yanking by motivating your dog to follow you
with an excited voice to get her attention. When she is following you
and the leash is relaxed, turn back and continue on your way. It may
take a few turns, but your vocal cues and body
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page211}language will make it
clear that pulling will not be reinforced with forward movement, whereas
walking calmly by your side or even slightly in front of you on a loose
leash will allow your dog to get to where she wants to go. You can also
reinforce your dog's decision to walk close to you by giving her a
motivating reward when she is by your side.

### VARY THE PICTURE {.section}

Once your dog is listening to you, you can vary the picture even more by
becoming unpredictable yourself. This requires your dog to listen to you
at all times, because she never knows when you might turn or where you
are going to go next. Instead of turning away from her when you give the
"let's go" cue, reverse direction by turning toward her. You can turn in
a circle or do a figure eight. Any of these variations will get your
dog's attention. Don't forget to praise her for complying, because the
better you make her feel when she's walking close to you, the more she
will choose to do so.

### TEACHING THE "CLOSE" CUE {.section}

Walking well on a leash and walking right next to you are separate leash
manner skills that your dog can learn.

As a dog's walking pace is naturally faster than a human's, be aware of
how difficult it is for some dogs to modify their pace to suit yours.
For some dogs, walking close to your side would be the same as if you
were only allowed to walk down the street taking tiny baby steps---not
easy or fun to do for long. Try starting this exercise beside a wall in
your home so that your dog is between you and the wall. This makes it
easier for her to stay close to your side.

::: hanging01
    • []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page212}Teach your dog to
follow a piece of food that you have in your hand. If your dog is not
food motivated, use a toy instead.

    • Show the food to your dog and then put it in your left or right
hand. Hold your hand against the left or right side of your body,
whichever is more comfortable so she learns to follow the food in your
hand.

    • Move forward and encourage her to follow the food, which now acts
as a lure.

    • Walk for about ten steps and then stop. Praise your dog and reward
her with the food. If you want her to sit at this time, either give her
the cue word or move closer into her body while saying "stop." That will
teach her to stop and sit at the same time.

    • Repeat this exercise several times, gradually increasing the
number of steps you take.
:::

Your goal is to show your dog that walking next to you brings her good
things. The lure in your hand is the motivator and helps build up a hand
signal that you can use with or without the "close" cue word.

::: hanging01
    • Repeat this technique until your dog is responding well. Say your
dog's name followed by the cue "close" and move off with your hand
tapping your side to encourage her to follow.

    • Once you have compliance, begin using food intermittently while
still praising her. If your dog goes in front of you, reverse direction
and repeat the cue, tapping your thigh again. Praise her warmly.

    • Vary the routine by turning left and right or doing a figure
eight, saying "close" as you turn. The sit when you stop should now be
automatic.
:::

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page213}Make sure the close cue
is well conditioned indoors before trying it out on the street. Don't
expect your dog to walk right next to you all the time, but consider
your dog's walking on a loose leash acceptable, with the close position
available when you need it, reinforcing it for practice.

## Eating Poop {.section}

My family and I were so excited to welcome our newest addition. We had
found her at the shelter, curled up in a kennel run surrounded by other
small dogs, wearing a pink "bunny girl" sweater with the words "Miss
January" written on it. My intention was to rescue a dog that was
sociable and outgoing, so naturally I fell for this fearful
Chihuahua-Terrier mix curled up in the corner. Jasmine came into our
lives, and we were relieved that with time and patience she blossomed
into a quirky little pup that fell in love with us and her new canine
buddy Sadie.

But because of her bad start in life, Jasmine had certain issues that
had to be addressed, including one particularly unsavory habit: she
loved to play with, sleep in, and eat poop. I discovered this one day
while watching Sadie in the backyard and realized with horror that
Jasmine was waiting behind Sadie's bottom as she toileted. As soon as
the fresh, brown snack was accessible, Jasmine attacked it like a
starved animal. I ran over, scooped her up and took her away from the
offensive mess, but she was completely unfazed by my interruption,
licking her lips to make sure she got every last delicious morsel.

As much as I explain to people that eating stool, though disgusting to
us humans, is very normal in the dog world, I was horrified at the
realization that *I* had a poop-eating dog. For a while I hoped that
this had been an isolated incident, but unfortunately Jasmine proved me
wrong. One bright fall morning while I was
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page214}out of town filming *It's
Me or the Dog*, my husband had put Jasmine in her crate for safety so
that she couldn't walk around the house unsupervised while he took a
shower. Coming out of the bathroom, he noticed a pungent smell, and with
a quick inspection he saw that Jasmine had indeed pooped in her crate.
As she was still new to us and not crate-trained (that is, trained not
to toilet in the crate), my husband calmly cleaned up the mess and took
her with him into his home office. She snuggled up on the chair next to
him and all was peaceful until she began to gag. Fearing the worst, my
husband cupped his hand under her chin as she vomited. Cursing quietly,
he looked down at the mess to see what had made her throw up, and in the
palm of his hand lay a nicely rounded ball of fresh stool. True to that
earlier incident, Jasmine had eaten a decent portion of her most recent
elimination.

Of course we humans find the thought of our dogs eating poop (called
*coprophagia*) disgusting, but the unsavory fact is that some dogs find
eating feces pleasurable. A dog may eat her own stool or that of another
animal simply because she likes the taste. Cat poop is high on the list
of tasty treats because of its high protein content and smell, but dogs
consider deer and rabbit feces pretty scrumptious, too. Sadie and
Jasmine love to hike with us in the mountains because there is always a
feast of deer poop lying in wait for them.

Dogs that have a malabsorption disorder might not be able to easily
extract the nutrients they need from the food, so stool becomes another
chance to fulfill that nutritional
need.[^2^](#Stil_9781607744153_epub_end_r1.htm#c10-nts2){#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-nts2a
.hlink} Other dogs eat feces because they're always hungry and enjoy
getting two meals for the price of one. Simply feeding your dog a
higher-quality food as well as dividing the food into multiple smaller
meals throughout the day may satisfy the dog's hunger and quell the need
to indulge elsewhere.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page215}Although coprophagia is
sometimes the result of a variety of medical conditions---including
pancreatitis, intestinal infection, or food allergies---most cases are
behavioral in nature. A new mother will stimulate her puppies to urinate
and defecate by licking the anogenital area and will ingest the feces to
keep the den clean. This makes the sleeping environment healthier for
the pups and less detectable to predators. Because coprophagia can be a
learned behavior, pups sometimes mimic their mother, in which case the
action becomes a habit and is particularly hard to stop. Some mothers
continue to eat poop after their puppies have been weaned because they
find it pleasurable. Adult dogs may learn to eat poop by seeing other
dogs indulging in the practice or because of human reinforcement. I once
worked with a dog that toileted in the house, picked it up, and ran out
the door to bury it in the backyard. I later discovered that a history
of punishment after toileting in the home had actually taught him to
take his poop and hide the evidence for fear of being punished if he was
caught again.

Whatever the cause, eating feces can be unhealthy, especially if the
stool is from an animal with intestinal parasites or an infectious
disease. That's why even though Jasmine seemed to only like eating
Sadie's stool as well as her own, I wanted to nip this behavior in the
bud.

Jasmine had had a difficult start in life. The people who dropped her
off at the shelter in a cardboard box told the staff that she rarely
left her crate because she toileted around their home. So in addition to
her being poorly housetrained, I suspected that Jasmine's poop-eating
habit was the result of boredom and lack of proper care. I find this is
often the case with puppies and dogs that come from puppy mills and pet
stores. These dogs grow up in relative social isolation with no comfort
and nothing to entertain them throughout the day, so the only thing they
find to play with is their own feces. I noticed that Jasmine liked to
pick up her poop []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page216}and play
with it like a ball---something she must have done frequently during
many long, lonely hours of confinement.

Providing her with activity toys was a simple solution to this part of
the problem. I wouldn't have been surprised if Jasmine had never seen a
toy before she came to live with us, but when I rolled a ball toward her
she jumped on it with delight and gleefully chased it around the room.
As soon as I introduced her to toys and allowed her the freedom to play,
she lost interest in playing with her poop. Jasmine is an orally fixated
dog, continually using her mouth to explore her world by barking,
licking, mouthing, nibbling, and chewing. By giving her durable chew
toys, all of her energy, frustration, and oral needs could be directed
onto something more appropriate. I also noticed that my little dog was a
natural scavenger and, like many such dogs, ate everything she could
find. I harnessed her scavenging needs by hiding toys around the house
and teaching her to go and find them---the canine equivalent of a
treasure hunt.

I also suspected that Jasmine was eating her feces simply because she
liked the taste. Even though a dog's taste capabilities might not be as
sensitive as ours, sense of smell plays a huge role in stimulating
hunger, so if something smells nice, chances are it's going to taste
nice too. With this in mind, some people try to stop their dogs eating
feces by putting something bitter on the poop so that the smell and
taste become offensive. The trouble with this practice is that bitter
tastes are detected only if they pass over the rear third of the tongue,
where the "bitter" taste buds are located, and if a dog gulps down her
food in one bite, the unpleasant taste won't even register. This is also
true if the bitter food is dry. Sprinkling poop with pepper, pineapple,
or mint works occasionally, but some dogs experience adverse reactions
to these substances. Cophrophagic dogs tend to eat very fast during
mealtimes, which is part of the scavenger's instinct to eat food quickly
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page217}before someone else gets
a share. If your dog is inhaling her food at mealtimes and choking in
the process, this is easily rectified by using a contoured feeding bowl
or feeding all her meals through activity toys instead.

The only really effective solution for a poop-eating dog is to be
vigilant and remove the feces as soon as the dog has toileted to avoid
any chance of ingestion. Being aware of both of my dogs' toileting
habits and removing the stool immediately meant that Jasmine was never
able to indulge in the unsavory practice. Because her life is much
richer and her diet is so healthy, an unpleasant habit has thankfully
become a thing of the past.

## Mouthing {.section}

Libby Evans sat down on the sofa, rolled up her sleeves, and showed me
her arms. They were covered in bruises, gashes, and pitted holes that
looked like cigarettes had been extinguished on them. "He started
mouthing when he was four months old," she said, "and has never stopped.
We've tried everything we know of to stop him biting us, but now he's
getting too big and too dangerous."

Before we could talk any further, a tall, skinny male yellow Labrador
leapt over the baby gate and ran over to Libby, throwing himself onto
her lap and covering her face with licks. As she pushed him off, he
redirected his attention onto her arms and began to mouth them as if
they had just become two fabulous chew toys. He was relentless and
oblivious to her protests, stopping only when he spied me in the room.
In one swift move he turned and bolted toward me, leapt onto my lap, and
began showering me with licks. Quickly tiring of this activity, he then
hurled himself onto the floor to play with a half-chewed bone.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page218}At first it seemed that
Harvey was just being overly rambunctious, but as I observed him further
he seemed to be getting increasingly frustrated. Having finished with
the toy, he flung himself toward Libby once again and jumped on her with
a wicked look in his eye. The more she told him no, the more his
roughness increased and the harder he mouthed her arms. In a desperate
attempt to stop the assault Libby screamed at him. Harvey stopped
mouthing, curled the top of his lip into a frightening snarl, and leapt
at her in a fit of rage. Before any more damage could be done, I ran to
the other side of the room and started waving a toy like a crazy woman.
As Harvey charged at me, I threw the toy into the kitchen and shut the
door behind him as he ran to retrieve it. Libby looked at me with tears
in her eyes and collapsed onto the sofa. For her the game had finished
once and for all. Harvey had just had his last chance.

Harvey had been a Mother's Day gift. Libby's husband had neglected to
get his wife a present, so while he was in the mall with his sons on a
desperate, last-minute mission to save face, he spied a funny-looking
puppy in the window of a pet store. Feeling his heart melt and wanting
to gain kudos with his wife (who was still mourning the loss of her late
beloved Labrador), he asked to see the puppy. Even though he knew that
getting a puppy was not a great idea, good judgment flew out the window,
and he left the store holding a squirmy little bundle of energy in his
arms.

From the beginning, Libby noticed that Harvey never made eye contact
with the family and didn't seem to want or need cuddles or attention. He
slept less than "normal" puppies and was always getting into trouble. He
was difficult to toilet train and didn't listen to anyone. He was taken
to training class but was too distracted to learn anything so was asked
to leave. He hated his crate and at night didn't give the family a
moment's peace. He chewed the sofa cushions and had now begun to lift
his leg and []{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page219}mark
everything inside the home. Harvey seemed to be oblivious to any
punishment, however severe. The family began to resent their puppy, and
Harvey spent longer and longer periods in his crate. He was nothing like
their former Labrador, and Libby's husband now regretted his purchase.

Mouthing is very normal in young puppies and begins as soon as they
learn to suckle, bringing them food and comfort. When puppy teeth start
coming through around three weeks of age, puppies learn that biting too
hard on their mother either earns a reprimand or means that the source
of food and comfort gets up and walks away. They also learn that
mouthing, nipping, or biting their littermates too hard during play
stops the game. When a puppy goes into a human home, owners must
continue to let the puppy know that mouthing on clothes and skin is
unacceptable. People who play roughly with their young dogs are
reinforcing mouthy behavior through this play and often make it worse.
Sometimes rough play causes arousal or anger, and the mouthing turns
into something much more serious.

When puppies are taken away from their mother and littermates too early,
they don't learn to inhibit their bite. Puppies from pet stores, for
example, typically have mouthing issues because they are taken away from
their mothers too soon at the puppy mill and are raised in sterile
environments just at the most crucial time for social development. If
these pups don't learn how to use their mouths correctly, their play
bite becomes very hard. A dog that mouths hard in play also has the
capacity to use her mouth when frustrated and angry.

All puppies and dogs need clear, consistent feedback from their human
families that mouthing is unacceptable so that lessons learned from
their canine mothers will transition well to a human home. Some trainers
like to teach their dogs that gentle mouthing is acceptable, but I've
found that clients have a hard
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page220}time defining what is
"acceptable" and what is not. What might be a soft mouth on an adult's
arm, for example, is completely unacceptable on a child or elderly
person's body, and even dogs with soft mouths can apply harder pressure
when aroused. If I am playing with a pup that mouths me, I immediately
stop the game either by removing the toy we are playing with or by
getting up and walking away. I then wait for about ten seconds and
resume the game. If the mouthing starts again, I repeat the process
until the puppy learns that mouthing me stops play. Some pups and older
dogs may continue to nip as I walk away. In these cases I have another
person hold a very loose leash and gently guide the dog away. I also
like to supply pups with toys to chew on, both to relieve the pressure
on their teething gums and to redirect their mouthing from humans to
something more appropriate.

Harvey, however, had been harshly reprimanded so frequently for his
behavior that he became unresponsive and disconnected from his family.
This in turn angered his family, who couldn't understand why their dog
never listened to them. Harvey received continual punishment for all the
things he did wrong and no praise for the few things he managed to do
right. He spent an average of six to eight hours each day in his crate
while the couple went to work. They had hired a dog walker to walk him
during the day, but those walks had recently been stopped due to
liability issues. By the time the family got home in the late afternoon,
Harvey was a ball of pent-up energy. He exploded from his crate when
released and didn't relent until he was put to bed at night.

As I gained more information from each family member, the picture became
clearer. Harvey wasn't a bad dog; he was a bored, unstimulated, and
frustrated adolescent that had been given too little exercise, few
boundaries, and very little positive experience in his short life.
Instead of looking at how his
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page221}upbringing was affecting
his behavior, the couple had concluded that Harvey was to blame.

I see this scenario all too often: despite there being so much education
available on where to get a puppy and how to raise it successfully,
Harvey had been an impulse buy, which is often doomed to fail right from
the start. All too often companion-animal impulse buys end up being
given away. As long as the pet stores keep selling puppies, puppy mills
keep producing them, and people keep buying them, the cycle will
continue.

In the meantime, Harvey's mind was spinning out of control. He was
unable to focus on any one thing for more than a few seconds and was in
constant motion, unable to settle. The four walls of the house were
closing in on him, and the backyard had long ago ceased to be an
exciting place. What Harvey needed was a large field to run and play in,
a family that had more time for him, long walks, and a breed-specific
sport or activity at which he could excel. There was no doubt in my mind
that he would make an exceptional working dog, but I doubted that the
family would be able to give him what he needed.

The first step in my behavior modification plan was to increase Harvey's
daily exercise and put him on a predictable schedule. He was to be
walked for at least an hour every day, which would increase when he
reached adulthood. During the week, Harvey would go to day care (which
he loved) for three days and would be walked twice a day by the dog
walker for the rest of the working week. I usually recommend a mixture
of day care and dog walkers, as some dogs become too overwhelmed or
overstimulated going to day care every day. The family would walk Harvey
on the weekends on a chest-led harness that eliminated his pulling so
that Libby and her husband could easily teach him to walk properly on a
regular leash and collar. I made his crate a much more pleasant place to
be so that Harvey would feel comfortable using it for a
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page222}nap or chew time or to
have space away from the family when he needed it. Harvey's day became
more structured, with teaching, chew time on appropriate toys, play, and
walks with the family.

Because Libby's two boys had also experienced Harvey's hard mouth, I
wanted to give them a way to interact and play safely with him under
their parents' supervision. I tied a soft toy to a long rope and
attached the rope to the end of an extendable pole. The pole and the
rope kept the toy away from the children's bodies as they whirled it
around, ensuring they had no physical contact with Harvey as he chased
the toy. Now they could play with him safely without threat of injury if
play got too rough. The game could also only be played if Harvey abided
by the rules: lying down and waiting until the kids gave him the release
cue to chase---a great lesson in self-control.

The results of increased attention and activity were almost immediate.
For the first time in his life, Harvey actually began to enjoy
interaction with his human family, and they in turn learned how to
praise him, which gave him confidence. He was still an energetic dog
that required a lot of time and energy, but things were improving. At
the end of the day, living with an out-of-control Labrador might make
for an entertaining Hollywood movie, but as Libby and her family found
out, the reality can be very different.

If a dog must expend more energy controlling her impulses, she will have
less energy to perform tasks that teach her self-control, so bear this
in mind and observe when your dog has had enough. Remember that it can
take longer for problem behaviors to be extinguished in adolescent dogs
than in adults because adolescents have a harder time inhibiting their
responses. If you are sensitive to your dog's needs, you will be able to
tailor the teaching for maximum effect. Whether your dog inhibits her
behavior consciously or unconsciously, never forget to tell her when
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_c10_r1.htm#page223}she is doing a good job,
because your feedback will make all the difference.

## In Conclusion {.section}

Building and maintaining a healthy, balanced relationship with your dog
doesn't have to be a battle. Although the teaching process can
occasionally be difficult in our "I want it NOW" culture, taking the
time to truly understand where our dogs came from, how they learn, and
what they need in order to succeed in our strange, domesticated world
can lead to one of the most satisfying and enriching relationships life
can provide. The concepts, protocols, and techniques in this book are
designed to help all owners more effectively and successfully live up to
their end of the bargain of being their dog's best friend, whether the
dog is generally well-behaved and needs only minor guidance and
adjustments or suffers from more significant, ingrained behavioral
issues. When we welcome dogs into our lives, we are signing an unwritten
social contract that affirms our responsibility not just to care for,
feed, and walk them, but also to help give them all the tools they need
to experience the fullest, most rewarding life experience possible.
Achieving this is possible only if we harness the power of positive
training and ignore the shortcuts and pitfalls of punishment and
dominance concepts.

As you continue the never-ending journey of discovery and fulfillment
that comes with building a positive relationship with your dog, remember
to be patient, positive, and persistent. Good luck!

Born and raised in Wimbledon, England, VICTORIA STILWELL is one of the
world's most recognized and respected dog trainers. She is best known
for her role as the star of her hit TV series *It's Me or the Dog*
through which she is able to share her insight and passion for positive
reinforcement dog training, and as a judge on CBS's *Greatest American
Dog*. Having filmed over one hundred episodes since 2005, Stilwell
reaches audiences in over fifty countries while counseling families on
their pet problems.

[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_ata_r1.htm#page240}In the early 1990s,
Stilwell began her career in pet training when she created her own
successful dog-walking company and immediately recognized the need for
qualified professionals to help her clients with the training process.
While pursuing a successful acting career (working in London's West End
as well as in numerous films, TV series, commercials, and voiceovers),
she expanded her focus to dog training by learning from some of
Britain's most respected positive reinforcement dog trainers and
behaviorists.

After moving to the United States with her husband, Stilwell cofounded
several successful dog training companies up and down the East Coast,
quickly establishing herself as one of New York's most sought-after dog
trainers. With a particular fondness for rescue animals in need of
behavior rehabilitation, Stilwell devoted much of her time and energy to
a number of animal rescue organizations in New York and Atlanta, serving
as a behavior advisor and giving regular seminars on the subject of dog
rescue, training, and rehabilitation while becoming one of the leading
voices in the field of dog training and behavior.

A passionate advocate for positive reinforcement dog training methods,
Stilwell is the editor in chief of
[Positively.com](http://Positively.com){.hlink}, which features the
world's leading veterinary behaviorists, dog trainers, and behavioral
scientists on her Positively Expert Blog. She is a vocal opponent of
punitive, dominance-based training techniques that often result in
"quick fixes" but ultimately cause more long-term harm than good while
damaging the owner-dog relationship. Her first two best-selling books,
*It's Me or the Dog: How to Have the Perfect Pet* and *Fat Dog Slim: How
to Have a Healthy, Happy Pet*, have been widely praised.

A regular guest on talk shows, news broadcasts, and radio programs in
the United States, Europe, and Asia, Stilwell was named 2009's Dog
Trainer of the Year at the Purina ProPlan Dog
[]{#Stil_9781607744153_epub_ata_r1.htm#page241}awards and was the
recipient of the prestigious 2011 Excellence in Journalism and
Outstanding Contributions to the Pet Industry Award. *It's Me or the
Dog* has been the recipient of multiple honors including 2011 and 2012
Genesis Award Nominations and a 2009 People's Choice Award nomination.
Stilwell is a regular columnist for several magazines and has been
featured in numerous journals, magazines, and newspapers including the
*New York Times, USA Today, Cosmopolitan, Time.com, Oprah, Rachael Ray
Everyday, MSNBC.com, Self, Shape*, the *Daily Mail*, and the *Sun*.

Stilwell is the CEO of Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog Training---the
world's premier global network of positive reinforcement dog trainers.
In addition to her globally available Positively Podcast series, she
also produces several shows in her role as the director of training and
behavior for the popular eHow Pets YouTube channel.

Stilwell is committed to helping the cause of animal rescue and
rehabilitation and is heavily involved with organizations around the
world to increase awareness of puppy mills, dog fighting, animal abuse,
pet overpopulation, dog bite prevention, and other animal-related
causes. A cofounder of the national Dog Bite Prevention conference
series, Stilwell is also a National Ambassador for the American Humane
Association and serves on the advisory boards of both RedRover and
DogTV. She is a member of several professional dog training
associations.

Victoria currently resides in Atlanta with her husband, Van, daughter,
Alex, and two rescue dogs, Sadie and Jasmine.
