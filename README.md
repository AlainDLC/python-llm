# Jupyter Notebooks for AI Models

This project is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks where I will run various projects using different AI models. I will update this README and add descriptions of each project and its purpose as I code.

## Installation Instructions

To run Jupyter Notebooks and the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/jupyter-ai-models.git
    cd jupyter-ai-models
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

This will open a Jupyter Notebook session in your browser.

## AI Models and Projects

Each notebook in this repository will include details on the specific AI model used, example code, and data required, as well as any documentation to understand and improve the models.

- **Project 1: [Model Name]**
    - Description: A brief description of the project and goal.
    - Model: [AI Model Name, e.g., GPT-3, BERT, etc.]
    - Data: Description of the dataset used in this project.
    - Tools: Libraries and tools used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face).
    - Usage: How to run the code and experiment with the model.

## Command Examples

Example of loading an AI model and making a prediction:

```python
# Example of loading an AI model and making a prediction
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.h5')
prediction = model.predict(input_data)
# python-llm
